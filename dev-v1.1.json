               "context":"FIVE DEBATES OVER  MACROECONOMIC POLICY   It is hard to open up the newspaper without finding some politician or editorial  writer advocating a change in economic policy.The president should use the budget  surplus to reduce government debt, or he should use it to increase government  spending.The Federal Reserve should cut interest rates to stimulate a flagging  economy, or it should avoid such moves in order not to risk higher inflation.Congress  should reform the tax system to promote faster economic growth, or it  should reform the tax system to achieve a more equal distribution of income.Economic  issues are central to the continuing political debate in the United States and  other countries around the world.It is no surprise that when Bill Clinton first ran  for president in 1992, his chief strategist posted a sign to remind the staff of the  central campaign issue: \u201cThe economy, stupid.\u201d   The previous dozen chapters have developed the tools that economists use  when analyzing the behavior of the economy as a whole and the impact of policies   IN THIS CHAPTER  YOU WILL .Consider whether  policymakers should  try to stabilize  the economy   Consider whether  monetary policy  should be made by  rule rather than  by discretion   Consider whether the  central bank should  aim for zero inflation   Consider whether  fiscal policymakers  should reduce the  government debt   Consider whether  the tax laws should  be reformed to  encourage saving   503   \f 504 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   on the economy.This final chapter presents both sides in five leading debates over  macroeconomic policy.The knowledge you have accumulated in this course provides  the background with which we can discuss these important, unsettled issues.It should help you choose a side in these debates or, at least, help you see  why choosing a side is so difficult.SHOULD MONETARY AND FISCAL POLICYMAKERS  TRY TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY?In Chapters 19, 20, and 21, we saw how changes in aggregate demand and aggregate  supply can lead to short-run fluctuations in production and employment.We  also saw how monetary and fiscal policy can shift aggregate demand and, thereby,  influence these fluctuations.But even if policymakers can influence short-run economic  fluctuations, does that mean they should?Our first debate concerns whether  monetary and fiscal policymakers should use the tools at their disposal in an attempt  to smooth the ups and downs of the business cycle.PRO: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD TRY  TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY   Left on their own, economies tend to fluctuate.When households and firms become  pessimistic, for instance, they cut back on spending, and this reduces the aggregate  demand for goods and services.The fall in aggregate demand, in turn,  reduces the production of goods and services.Firms lay off workers, and the unemployment  rate rises.Real GDP and other measures of income fall.Rising unemployment  and falling income help confirm the pessimism that initially generated  the economic downturn.Such a recession has no benefit for society\u2014it represents a sheer waste of resources.Workers who become unemployed because of inadequate aggregate demand  would rather be working.Business owners whose factories are left idle  during a recession would rather be producing valuable goods and services and  selling them at a profit.There is no reason for society to suffer through the booms and busts of the  business cycle.The development of macroeconomic theory has shown policymakers  how to reduce the severity of economic fluctuations.By \u201cleaning against  the wind\u201d of economic change, monetary and fiscal policy can stabilize aggregate  demand and, thereby, production and employment.When aggregate demand is  inadequate to ensure full employment, policymakers should boost government  spending, cut taxes, and expand the money supply.When aggregate demand  is excessive, risking higher inflation, policymakers should cut government  spending, raise taxes, and reduce the money supply.Such policy actions put  macroeconomic theory to its best use by leading to a more stable economy, which  benefits everyone.CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 505   CON: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD NOT TRY  TO STABILIZE THE ECONOMY   Although monetary and fiscal policy can be used to stabilize the economy in theory,  there are substantial obstacles to the use of such policies in practice.One problem is that monetary and fiscal policy do not affect the economy immediately  but instead work with a long lag.Monetary policy affects aggregate demand  by changing interest rates, which in turn affect spending, especially  residential and business investment.But many households and firms set their  spending plans in advance.As a result, it takes time for changes in interest rates to  alter the aggregate demand for goods and services.Many studies indicate that  changes in monetary policy have little effect on aggregate demand until about six  months after the change is made.Fiscal policy works with a lag because of the long political process that governs  changes in spending and taxes.To make any change in fiscal policy, a bill  must go through congressional committees, pass both the House and the Senate,  and be signed by the president.It can take years to propose, pass, and implement  a major change in fiscal policy.Because of these long lags, policymakers who want to stabilize the economy  need to look ahead to economic conditions that are likely to prevail when their actions  will take effect.Unfortunately, economic forecasting is highly imprecise, in  part because macroeconomics is such a primitive science and in part because the  shocks that cause economic fluctuations are intrinsically unpredictable.Thus,  when policymakers change monetary or fiscal policy, they must rely on educated  guesses about future economic conditions.All too often, policymakers trying to stabilize the economy do just the opposite.Economic conditions can easily change between the time when a policy action  begins and when it takes effect.Because of this, policymakers can inadvertently    \f 506 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   exacerbate rather than mitigate the magnitude of economic fluctuations.Some  economists have claimed that many of the major economic fluctuations in history,  including the Great Depression of the 1930s, can be traced to destabilizing policy  actions.One of the first rules taught to physicians is \u201cdo no harm.\u201d The human body  has natural restorative powers.Confronted with a sick patient and an uncertain  diagnosis, often a doctor should do nothing but leave the patient\u2019s body to its own  devices.Intervening in the absence of reliable knowledge merely risks making  matters worse.The same can be said about treating an ailing economy.It might be desirable if  policymakers could eliminate all economic fluctuations, but that is not a realistic  goal given the limits of macroeconomic knowledge and the inherent unpredictability  of world events.Economic policymakers should refrain from intervening  often with monetary and fiscal policy and be content if they do no harm.QUICK QUIZ: Explain why monetary and fiscal policy work with a lag.Why do these lags matter in the choice between active and passive policy?SHOULD MONETARY POLICY BE MADE BY RULE  RATHER THAN BY DISCRETION?As we first discussed in Chapter 15, the Federal Open Market Committee sets  monetary policy in the United States.The committee meets about every six  weeks to evaluate the state of the economy.Based on this evaluation and forecasts  of future economic conditions, it chooses whether to raise, lower, or leave unchanged  the level of short-term interest rates.The Fed then adjusts the money  supply to reach that interest-rate target until the next meeting, when the target is  reevaluated.The Federal Open Market Committee operates with almost complete discretion  over how to conduct monetary policy.The laws that created the Fed give the  institution only vague recommendations about what goals it should pursue.And  they do not tell the Fed how to pursue whatever goals it might choose.Once members  are appointed to the Federal Open Market Committee, they have little mandate  but to \u201cdo the right thing.\u201d   Some economists are critical of this institutional design.Our second debate  over macroeconomic policy, therefore, focuses on whether the Federal Reserve  should have its discretionary powers reduced and, instead, be committed to following  a rule for how it conducts monetary policy.PRO: MONETARY POLICY SHOULD BE MADE BY RULE   Discretion in the conduct of monetary policy has two problems.The first is that it  does not limit incompetence and abuse of power.When the government sends   \f CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 507   police into a community to maintain civic order, it gives them strict guidelines  about how to carry out their job.Because police have great power, allowing them  to exercise that power in whatever way they want would be dangerous.Yet when  the government gives central bankers the authority to maintain economic order,  it gives them no guidelines.Monetary policymakers are allowed undisciplined  discretion.As an example of abuse of power, central bankers are sometimes tempted to  use monetary policy to affect the outcome of elections.Suppose that the vote for  the incumbent president is based on economic conditions at the time he is up for  reelection.A central banker sympathetic to the incumbent might be tempted to  pursue expansionary policies just before the election to stimulate production and  employment, knowing that the resulting inflation will not show up until after the  election.Thus, to the extent that central bankers ally themselves with politicians,  discretionary policy can lead to economic fluctuations that reflect the electoral calendar.Economists call such fluctuations the political business cycle.The second, more subtle, problem with discretionary monetary policy is that  it might lead to more inflation than is desirable.Central bankers, knowing that  there is no long-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, often announce  that their goal is zero inflation.Yet they rarely achieve price stability.Perhaps it is because, once the public forms expectations of inflation,  policymakers face a short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.They are tempted to renege on their announcement of price stability in order to  achieve lower unemployment.This discrepancy between announcements (what  policymakers say they are going to do) and actions (what they subsequently in  fact do) is called the time inconsistency of policy.Because policymakers are so often  time inconsistent, people are skeptical when central bankers announce their intentions  to reduce the rate of inflation.As a result, people always expect more  inflation than monetary policymakers claim they are trying to achieve.Higher expectations  of inflation, in turn, shift the short-run Phillips curve upward, making  the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment less favorable than it  otherwise might be.One way to avoid these two problems with discretionary policy is to commit  the central bank to a policy rule.For example, suppose that Congress passed a law  requiring the Fed to increase the money supply by exactly 3 percent per year.(Why  3 percent?Because real GDP grows on average about 3 percent per year and because  money demand grows with real GDP, 3 percent growth in the money supply  is roughly the rate necessary to produce long-run price stability.)Such a law would  eliminate incompetence and abuse of power on the part of the Fed, and it would  make the political business cycle impossible.In addition, policy could no longer be  time inconsistent.People would now believe the Fed\u2019s announcement of low inflation  because the Fed would be legally required to pursue a low-inflation monetary  policy.With low expected inflation, the economy would face a more favorable  short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.Other rules for monetary policy are also possible.A more active rule might allow  some feedback from the state of the economy to changes in monetary policy.For example, a more active rule might require the Fed to increase monetary growth  by 1 percentage point for every percentage point that unemployment rises above  its natural rate.Regardless of the precise form of the rule, committing the Fed to  some rule would yield advantages by limiting incompetence, abuse of power, and  time inconsistency in the conduct of monetary policy.508 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   IN THE NEWS  Inflation Targeting  DURING THE 1990S, MANY CENTRAL BANKS  around the world adopted inflation  targeting as a rule\u2014or at least as a  rough guide\u2014for setting monetary  policy.Brazil is a recent example.Brazil to Use Inflation Data for  Managing Interest Rates   BY PETER FRITSCH  RIO DE JANEIRO\u2014Brazil\u2019s Central Bank  will adopt in late June a formal process  for managing interest rates based on  predefined inflation targets for the following  30 months, according to the  bank\u2019s president, Arminio Fraga.In an interview, Mr. Fraga said the  Central Bank is in the process of working  out the details of an \u201cinflation targeting\u201d  regime for managing interest rates  and the economy.Inflation targeting\u2014  a system used by other countries with  free-floating currencies such as Britain,  Canada, and New Zealand\u2014is fairly simple:  If prices are rising faster than expectations,  interest rates are lifted to cool  off the economy.If prices are falling or  steady, rates are cut.Once in place, Brazil\u2019s new policy  will look like the Bank of England\u2019s.Britain\u2019s central bank hitched interest- rate policy to a more visible price anchor  after the inflationary shock of the  pound\u2019s severe weakening in 1992.Today,  the United Kingdom targets annual  inflation at 2.5% over a two-year horizon  and adjusts short-term interest rates  when its price forecasts wander from  that goal by more than a percentage  point.In general, outside observers like  the simplicity of this policy.\u201cThe advantage  of targeting inflation is that  the Central Bank is less likely to   micromanage than if it is trying to target  the level of interest rates or the currency,\u201d  says Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  & Co. economist Ernest W. Brown.The downside of setting explicit targets  is that a hard-to-predict economy without  price controls like Brazil\u2019s is apt to miss  its inflation targets from time to time, and  miss them publicly.That causes some to worry about  the Brazilian Central Bank\u2019s lack of independence.Brazil\u2019s Central Bank reports  to the Finance Ministry, and thus to the  president.What if missing\u2014or hitting\u2014  an inflation target clashes with other administration  goals, such as reducing  unemployment?\u201cInflation targeting goes  in the right direction of trying to insulate  the Central Bank from politics,\u201d says   J. P. Morgan & Co. economist Marcelo  Carvalho.\u201cStill, introducing inflation targeting  without proper formal Central  Bank independence risks just pouring  old wine into new bottles.\u201d  SOURCE: The Wall Street Journal, May 22, 1999,  p. A8.CON: MONETARY POLICY SHOULD NOT BE MADE BY RULE   Although there may be pitfalls with discretionary monetary policy, there is also an  important advantage to it: flexibility.The Fed has to confront various circumstances,  not all of which can be foreseen.In the 1930s banks failed in record numbers.In the 1970s the price of oil skyrocketed around the world.In October 1987  the stock market fell by 22 percent in a single day.The Fed must decide how to respond  to these shocks to the economy.A designer of a policy rule could not possibly  consider all the contingencies and specify in advance the right policy response.It is better to appoint good people to conduct monetary policy and then give them  the freedom to do the best they can.Moreover, the alleged problems with discretion are largely hypothetical.The  practical importance of the political business cycle, for instance, is far from clear.In some cases, just the opposite seems to occur.For example, President Jimmy  Carter appointed Paul Volcker to head the Federal Reserve in 1979.Nonetheless, in   \f CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 509   October of that year Volcker moved to contract monetary policy to combat the  high rate of inflation that he had inherited from his predecessor.The predictable  result of Volcker\u2019s decision was a recession, and the predictable result of the recession  was a decline in Carter\u2019s popularity.Rather than using monetary policy to  help the president who had appointed him, Volcker helped to ensure Carter\u2019s defeat  by Ronald Reagan in the November 1980 election.The practical importance of time inconsistency is also far from clear.Although  most people are skeptical of central-bank announcements, central bankers can  achieve credibility over time by backing up their words with actions.In the 1990s,  the Fed achieved and maintained a low rate of inflation, despite the ever present  temptation to take advantage of the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.This experience shows that low inflation does not require that the  Fed be committed to a policy rule.Any attempt to replace discretion with a rule must confront the difficult task  of specifying a precise rule.Despite much research examining the costs and benefits  of alternative rules, economists have not reached a consensus about what a  good rule would be.Until there is a consensus, society has little choice but to give  central bankers discretion to conduct monetary policy as they see fit.QUICK QUIZ: Give an example of a monetary policy rule.Why might   your rule be better than discretionary policy?Why might it be worse?SHOULD THE CENTRAL BANK  AIM FOR ZERO INFLATION?One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1, and developed more  fully in Chapter 16, is that prices rise when the government prints too much  money.Another of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1, and developed  more fully in Chapter 21, is that society faces a short-run tradeoff between  inflation and unemployment.Put together, these two principles raise a question  for policymakers: How much inflation should the central bank be willing to tolerate?Our third debate is whether zero is the right target for the inflation rate.PRO: THE CENTRAL BANK SHOULD  AIM FOR ZERO INFLATION   Inflation confers no benefit on society, but it imposes several real costs.As we discussed  in Chapter 16, economists have identified six costs of inflation:     Shoeleather costs associated with reduced money holdings     Menu costs associated with more frequent adjustment of prices     Increased variability of relative prices     Unintended changes in tax liabilities due to nonindexation of the tax code    \f 510 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS     Confusion and inconvenience resulting from a changing unit of account     Arbitrary redistributions of wealth associated with dollar-denominated debts   Some economists argue that these costs are small, at least for moderate rates of inflation,  such as the 3 percent inflation experienced in the United States during the  1990s.But other economists claim these costs can be substantial, even for moderate  inflation.Moreover, there is no doubt that the public dislikes inflation.When  inflation heats up, opinion polls identify inflation as one of the nation\u2019s leading  problems.Of course, the benefits of zero inflation have to be weighed against the costs of  achieving it.Reducing inflation usually requires a period of high unemployment  and low output, as illustrated by the short-run Phillips curve.But this disinflationary  recession is only temporary.Once people come to understand that policymakers  are aiming for zero inflation, expectations of inflation will fall, and the  short-run tradeoff will improve.Because expectations adjust, there is no tradeoff  between inflation and unemployment in the long run.Reducing inflation is, therefore, a policy with temporary costs and permanent  benefits.That is, once the disinflationary recession is over, the benefits of zero inflation  would persist into the future.If policymakers are farsighted, they should be  willing to incur the temporary costs for the permanent benefits.This is precisely  the calculation made by Paul Volcker in the early 1980s, when he tightened monetary  policy and reduced inflation from about 10 percent in 1980 to about 4 percent  in 1983.Although in 1982 unemployment reached its highest level since the Great  Depression, the economy eventually recovered from the recession, leaving a legacy  of low inflation.Today Volcker is considered a hero among central bankers.Moreover, the costs of reducing inflation need not be as large as some economists  claim.If the Fed announces a credible commitment to zero inflation, it can  directly influence expectations of inflation.Such a change in expectations can improve  the short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, allowing the  economy to reach lower inflation at a reduced cost.The key to this strategy is credibility:  People must believe that the Fed is actually going to carry through on its  announced policy.Congress could help in this regard by passing legislation that  made price stability the Fed\u2019s primary goal.Such a law would make it less costly  to achieve zero inflation without reducing any of the resulting benefits.One advantage of a zero-inflation target is that zero provides a more natural  focal point for policymakers than any other number.Suppose, for instance, that the  Fed were to announce that it would keep inflation at 3 percent\u2014the rate experienced  during the 1990s.Would the Fed really stick to that 3 percent target?If  events inadvertently pushed inflation up to 4 or 5 percent, why wouldn\u2019t they just  raise the target?There is, after all, nothing special about the number 3.By contrast,  zero is the only number for the inflation rate at which the Fed can claim that it  achieved price stability and fully eliminated the costs of inflation.CON: THE CENTRAL BANK SHOULD NOT  AIM FOR ZERO INFLATION   Although price stability may be desirable, the benefits of zero inflation compared  to moderate inflation are small, whereas the costs of reaching zero inflation are   \f CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 511   large.Estimates of the sacrifice ratio suggest that reducing inflation by 1 percentage  point requires giving up about 5 percent of one year\u2019s output.Reducing inflation  from, say, 4 percent to zero requires a loss of 20 percent of a year\u2019s output.At  the current level of gross domestic product of about $9 trillion, this cost translates  into $1.8 trillion of lost output, which is about $6,500 per person.Although people  might dislike inflation, it is not at all clear that they would (or should) be willing  to pay this much to get rid of it.The social costs of disinflation are even larger than this $6,500 figure suggests,  for the lost income is not spread equitably over the population.When the economy  goes into recession, all incomes do not fall proportionately.Instead, the  fall in aggregate income is concentrated on those workers who lose their jobs.The vulnerable workers are often those with the least skills and experience.Hence, much of the cost of reducing inflation is borne by those who can least afford  to pay it.Although economists can list several costs of inflation, there is no professional  consensus that these costs are substantial.The shoeleather costs, menu costs, and  others that economists have identified do not seem great, at least for moderate  rates of inflation.It is true that the public dislikes inflation, but the public may be  misled into believing the inflation fallacy\u2014the view that inflation erodes living  standards.Economists understand that living standards depend on productivity,  not monetary policy.Because inflation in nominal incomes goes hand in hand with  inflation in prices, reducing inflation would not cause real incomes to rise more  rapidly.Moreover, policymakers can reduce many of the costs of inflation without actually  reducing inflation.They can eliminate the problems associated with the  nonindexed tax system by rewriting the tax laws to take account of the effects of  inflation.They can also reduce the arbitrary redistributions of wealth between  creditors and debtors caused by unexpected inflation by issuing indexed government  bonds, as in fact the Clinton administration did in 1997.Such an act insulates  holders of government debt from inflation.In addition, by setting an example, it  might encourage private borrowers and lenders to write debt contracts indexed for  inflation.Reducing inflation might be desirable if it could be done at no cost, as some  economists argue is possible.Yet this trick seems hard to carry out in practice.When economies reduce their rate of inflation, they almost always experience a period  of high unemployment and low output.It is risky to believe that the central  bank could achieve credibility so quickly as to make disinflation painless.Indeed, a disinflationary recession can potentially leave permanent scars on  the economy.Firms in all industries reduce their spending on new plants and  equipment substantially during recessions, making investment the most volatile  component of GDP.Even after the recession is over, the smaller stock of capital reduces  productivity, incomes, and living standards below the levels they otherwise  would have achieved.In addition, when workers become unemployed in recessions,  they lose valuable job skills.Even after the economy has recovered, their  value as workers is diminished.Some economists have argued that the high unemployment  in many European economies during the past decade is the aftermath  of the disinflations of the 1980s.Why should policymakers put the economy through a costly, inequitable dis- inflationary recession to achieve zero inflation, which may have only modest benefits?Economist Alan Blinder, whom Bill Clinton appointed to be vice chairman of   \f 512PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   the Federal Reserve, argued forcefully in his book Hard Heads, Soft Hearts that  policymakers should not make this choice:   The costs that attend the low and moderate inflation rates experienced in the  United States and in other industrial countries appear to be quite modest\u2014more  like a bad cold than a cancer on society.As rational individuals, we do not  volunteer for a lobotomy to cure a head cold.Yet, as a collectivity, we routinely  prescribe the economic equivalent of lobotomy (high unemployment) as a cure  for the inflationary cold.Blinder concludes that it is better to learn to live with moderate inflation.QUICK QUIZ: Explain the costs and benefits of reducing inflation to zero.Which are temporary and which are permanent?SHOULD FISCAL POLICYMAKERS  REDUCE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT?\u201cMY SHARE OF THE GOVERNMENT DEBT  IS $14,000.\u201d    Perhaps the most persistent macroeconomic debate in recent years has been over  the finances of the federal government.Throughout most of the 1980s and 1990s,  the U.S. federal government spent more than it collected in tax revenue and financed  this budget deficit by issuing government debt.When we studied financial  markets in Chapter 13, we saw how budget deficits affect saving, investment, and  interest rates.This situation reversed itself in the late 1990s, when a combination of tax hikes,  spending cuts, and strong economic growth eliminated the government\u2019s budget  deficit and even produced a small budget surplus.Our fourth debate concerns  whether fiscal policymakers should use this budget surplus to reduce the government  debt.The alternative is to eliminate the budget surplus by cutting taxes or  increasing spending.PRO: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD  REDUCE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT   The U.S. federal government is far more indebted today than it was two decades  ago.In 1980, the federal debt was $710 billion; in 1999, it was $3.7 trillion.If we divide  today\u2019s debt by the size of the population, we learn that each person\u2019s share  of the government debt is about $14,000.The most direct effect of the government debt is to place a burden on future  generations of taxpayers.When these debts and accumulated interest come due,  future taxpayers will face a difficult choice.They can pay higher taxes, enjoy less  government spending, or both, in order to make resources available to pay off the  debt and accumulated interest.Or they can delay the day of reckoning and put the  government into even deeper debt by borrowing once again to pay off the old debt  and interest.In essence, when the government runs a budget deficit and issues  government debt, it allows current taxpayers to pass the bill for some of their   \f CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 513   government spending on to future taxpayers.Inheriting such a large debt cannot  help but lower the living standard of future generations.In addition to this direct effect, budget deficits also have various macroeconomic  effects.Because budget deficits represent negative public saving, they lower  national saving (the sum of private and public saving).Reduced national saving  causes real interest rates to rise and investment to fall.Reduced investment leads  over time to a smaller stock of capital.A lower capital stock reduces labor productivity,  real wages, and the economy\u2019s production of goods and services.Thus,  when the government increases its debt, future generations are born into an economy  with lower incomes as well as higher taxes.There are, nevertheless, situations in which running a budget deficit is justifiable.Throughout history, the most common cause of increased government debt is  war.When a military conflict raises government spending temporarily, it is reasonable  to finance this extra spending by borrowing.Otherwise, taxes during  wartime would have to rise precipitously.Such high tax rates would greatly distort  the incentives faced by those who are taxed, leading to large deadweight  losses.In addition, such high tax rates would be unfair to current generations of  taxpayers, who already have to make the sacrifice of fighting the war.Similarly, it is reasonable to allow a rise in government debt during a temporary  downturn in economic activity.When the economy goes into a recession, tax  revenue falls automatically, because the income tax and the payroll tax are levied  on measures of income.If the government tried to balance its budget during a recession,  it would have to raise taxes or cut spending at a time of high unemployment.Such a policy would tend to depress aggregate demand at precisely the time  it needed to be stimulated and, therefore, would tend to increase the magnitude of  economic fluctuations.The rise in government debt during the 1980s and 1990s, however, cannot be  justified by appealing to war or recession.During this period, the United States  avoided major military conflict and major economic downturn.Nonetheless, the  government consistently ran a budget deficit, largely because the president and  Congress found it easier to increase government spending than to increase taxes.As a result, government debt as a percentage of annual gross domestic product increased  from 26 percent in 1980 to 50 percent in 1995, before falling back a bit to  44 percent in 1999.It is hard to see any rationale for this rise in government debt.If the U.S. government had been operating with a balanced budget since 1980,  today\u2019s college graduates would be entering an economy that promised them  greater economic prosperity.It\u2019s now time to reverse the effects of this policy mistake.A combination of  fiscal prudence and good luck left the U.S. government with a budget surplus in  the late 1990s and projected surpluses for subsequent years.We should use these  surpluses to repay some of the debt that the government has accumulated.Compared  to the alternative of cutting taxes or increasing spending, repaying the debt  would mean greater national saving, investment, and economic growth.CON: POLICYMAKERS SHOULD NOT  REDUCE THE GOVERNMENT DEBT   The problem of government debt is often exaggerated.Although the government  debt does represent a tax burden on younger generations, it is not large compared  to the average person\u2019s lifetime income.The debt of the U.S. federal government is   \f 514 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   about $14,000 per person.A person who works 40 years for $25,000 a year will earn  $1 million over his lifetime.His share of the government debt represents less than  2 percent of his lifetime resources.Moreover, it is misleading to view the effects of government debt in isolation.The government debt is just one piece of a large picture of how the government  chooses to raise and spend money.In making these decisions over fiscal policy,  policymakers affect different generations of taxpayers in many ways.The government\u2019s  budget deficit or surplus should be considered together with these other  policies.For example, suppose the government uses the budget surplus to pay off the  government debt instead of using it to pay for increased spending on education.Does this policy make young generations better off?The government debt will be  smaller when they enter the labor force, which means a smaller tax burden.Yet if  they are less well educated than they could be, their productivity and incomes will  be lower.Many estimates of the return to schooling (the increase in a worker\u2019s  wage that results from an additional year in school) find that it is quite large.Reducing  the government debt rather than funding more education spending could,  all things considered, make future generations worse off.Single-minded concern about the government debt is also dangerous because  it draws attention away from various other policies that redistribute income across  generations.For example, in the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. federal government  raised Social Security benefits for the elderly.It financed this higher spending by  increasing the payroll tax on the working-age population.This policy redistributed  income away from younger generations toward older generations, even though  it did not affect the government debt.Thus, government debt is only a small  piece of the larger issue of how government policy affects the welfare of different  generations.To some extent, the adverse effects of government debt can be reversed by  forward-looking parents.Suppose a parent is worried about the impact of the  government debt on his children.The parent can offset the impact simply by saving  and leaving a larger bequest.The bequest would enhance the children\u2019s ability  to bear the burden of future taxes.Some economists claim that people do in fact  behave this way.If this were true, higher private saving by parents would offset  the public dissaving of budget deficits, and deficits would not affect the economy.Most economists doubt that parents are so farsighted, but some people probably  do act this way, and anyone could.Deficits give people the opportunity to consume  at the expense of their children, but deficits do not require them to do so.If  the government debt actually represented a great problem facing future generations,  some parents would help to solve it.Critics of budget deficits sometimes assert that the government debt cannot  continue to rise forever, but in fact it can.Just as a bank officer evaluating a loan  application would compare a person\u2019s debts to his income, we should judge the  burden of the government debt relative to the size of the nation\u2019s income.Population  growth and technological progress cause the total income of the U.S. economy  to grow over time.As a result, the nation\u2019s ability to pay the interest on the government  debt grows over time as well.As long as the government debt grows  more slowly than the nation\u2019s income, there is nothing to prevent the government  debt from growing forever.Some numbers can put this into perspective.The real output of the U.S. economy  grows on average about 3 percent per year.If the inflation rate is 2 percent per   \f CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 515   IN THE NEWS  The Budget Surplus  WHEN POLICYMAKERS FACE GOVERNMENT  budget surpluses, they have three options:  cutting taxes, increasing spending,  or reducing the government debt.Choosing is not easy.Lawmakers Discover  That Surpluses  Can Be as Vexing as Deficits   BY DAVID WESSEL AND GREG HITT  WASHINGTON\u2014It took politicians 15 contentious  years to eliminate the biggest  federal budget deficits since World  War II.Now, they are having nearly as  much difficulty deciding what to do with  the roughly $3 trillion in surpluses projected  over the next 10 years.The sudden emergence of a budget  windfall larger than anticipated just six  months ago is forcing into fast-forward  a longstanding debate over fiscal policy  and the role of government.On the surface, lawmakers face a  simple multiple-choice question: Should  the surplus be saved, spent, or devoted  to tax cuts?But at its core, the debate  is about profound issues that were  long suppressed by the deficit-reduction  imperative:   How big should government be?DoAmericans prefer topay less in  taxes or have government do more?How much should younger workers sacrifice  to support baby-boomer parents  and grandparents in retirement, and how  much should baby-boomers set aside in  advance?How much should government  interfere with the workings of the market  to spread the benefits of today\u2019s prosperity?Is paying off debt incurred in the  1980s and 1990s more or less important  than raising spending on education and  health or lowering taxes?With something less than unanimity,  Republicans make the case for bigger  tax cuts and smaller government.\u201cRepublicans  believe it\u2019s a matter of principle  to return excess tax money in Washington  to the families and workers who  sent it here,\u201d House Ways and Means  Chairman Bill Archer, a Texas Republican,  said on the floor of the House of  Representatives during last week\u2019s tax- cut debate.\u201cRepublicans believe that  Americans have the right to keep more  of what they earn.\u201d   Where Republicans see an overtaxed  populace, however, liberal Democrats  in Congress see \u201cunmet needs.\u201d   \u201cThe question,\u201d says Rep. Barney  Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, \u201cis  not whether the surplus should be spent  according to people\u2019s wishes.Of course  it should.The question is whether it  should be spent on private goods or  public goods.\u201d .The public is split, but a new Wall  Street Journal/NBC News poll suggests  that the GOP is having trouble selling  its call for tax cuts.Asked to pick  just one option for using the surplus, 46    percent of the 1,007 respondents opted  for spending on social programs such as  education or a prescription-drug benefit  for Medicare recipients, 22 percent  picked paying down the federal debt, and  only 20 percent picked tax cuts.(The  rest picked defense or didn\u2019t make a  choice.)\u201cWe are not in a period like the  late 1970s when people really despised  government,\u201d says Republican pollster  Robert Teeter, who conducted the poll  with Democrat Peter Hart.\u201cThe electorate  is saying there are serious legitimate  issues that the government  should address, and they are willing to  use some of their money to do it,\u201d Mr.  Teeter adds.Fed Chairman Greenspan continues  to preach the virtues of debt reduction.Although he doesn\u2019t admit to as much,  he sees virtue in gridlock.If Congress  and Mr. Clinton can get appropriations  bills enacted this year, but agree on  nothing else, then the surplus will automatically  go to reducing the government  debt.SOURCE: The Wall Street Journal, July 29, 1999,  p. A1.516 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   year, then nominal income grows at a rate of 5 percent per year.The government  debt, therefore, can rise by 5 percent per year without increasing the ratio of debt  to income.In 1999 the federal government debt was $3.7 trillion; 5 percent of this  figure is $165 billion.As long as the federal budget deficit is smaller than $165 billion,  the policy is sustainable.There will never be any day of reckoning that forces  the budget deficits to end or the economy to collapse.If moderate budget deficits are sustainable, there is no need for the government  to maintain budget surpluses.Let\u2019s put this excess of revenue over spending  to better use.The government could use these funds to pay for valuable government  programs, such as increased funding for education.Or it could use them to  finance a tax cut.In the late 1990s taxes reached an historic high as a percentage of  GDP, so there is every reason to suppose that the deadweight losses of taxation  reached an historic high as well.If all these taxes aren\u2019t needed for current spending,  the government should return the money to the people who earned it.QUICK QUIZ: Explain how reducing the government debt makes future  generations better off.What fiscal policy might improve the lives of future  generations more than reducing the government debt?SHOULD THE TAX LAWS BE REFORMED TO  ENCOURAGE SAVING?A nation\u2019s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.This was one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1.As we saw in Chapter  12, a nation\u2019s productive capability, in turn, is determined largely by how much it  saves and invests for the future.Our fifth debate is whether policymakers should  reform the tax laws to encourage greater saving and investment.PRO: THE TAX LAWS SHOULD BE  REFORMED TO ENCOURAGE SAVING   A nation\u2019s saving rate is a key determinant of its long-run economic prosperity.When the saving rate is higher, more resources are available for investment in new  plant and equipment.A larger stock of plant and equipment, in turn, raises labor  productivity, wages, and incomes.It is, therefore, no surprise that international  data show a strong correlation between national saving rates and measures of economic  well-being.Another of the Ten Principles of Economics presented in Chapter 1 is that people  respond to incentives.This lesson should apply to people\u2019s decisions about how  much to save.If a nation\u2019s laws make saving attractive, people will save a higher  fraction of their incomes, and this higher saving will lead to a more prosperous  future.Unfortunately, the U.S. tax system discourages saving by taxing the return to  saving quite heavily.For example, consider a 25-year-old worker who saves $1,000   \f CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 517   of her income to have a more comfortable retirement at the age of 70.If she buys a  bond that pays an interest rate of 10 percent, the $1,000 will accumulate at the end  of 45 years to $72,900 in the absence of taxes on interest.But suppose she faces a  marginal tax rate on interest income of 40 percent, which is typical of many workers  once federal and state income taxes are added together.In this case, her after- tax interest rate is only 6 percent, and the $1,000 will accumulate at the end of 45  years to only $13,800.That is, accumulated over this long span of time, the tax rate  on interest income reduces the benefit of saving $1,000 from $72,900 to $13,800\u2014  or by about 80 percent.The tax code further discourages saving by taxing some forms of capital income  twice.Suppose a person uses some of his saving to buy stock in a corporation.When the corporation earns a profit from its capital investments, it first pays  tax on this profit in the form of the corporate income tax.If the corporation pays  out the rest of the profit to the stockholder in the form of dividends, the stockholder  pays tax on this income a second time in the form of the individual income  tax.This double taxation substantially reduces the return to the stockholder,  thereby reducing the incentive to save.The tax laws again discourage saving if a person wants to leave his accumulated  wealth to his children (or anyone else) rather than consuming it during his  lifetime.Parents can bequeath some money to their children without tax, but if the  bequest becomes large, the inheritance tax rate can be as high as 55 percent.To a  large extent, concern about national saving is motivated by a desire to ensure economic  prosperity for future generations.It is odd, therefore, that the tax laws discourage  the most direct way in which one generation can help the next.In addition to the tax code, many other policies and institutions in our society  reduce the incentive for households to save.Some government benefits, such as  welfare and Medicaid, are means-tested; that is, the benefits are reduced for those  who in the past have been prudent enough to save some of their income.Colleges  and universities grant financial aid as a function of the wealth of the students and  their parents.Such a policy is like a tax on wealth and, as such, discourages students  and parents from saving.There are various ways in which the tax code could provide an incentive to  save, or at least reduce the disincentive that households now face.Already the tax  laws give preferential treatment to some types of retirement saving.When a taxpayer  puts income into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), for instance, that  income and the interest it earns are not taxed until the funds are withdrawn at retirement.The tax code gives a similar tax advantage to retirement accounts that go  by other names, such as 401(k), 403(b), Keogh, and profit-sharing plans.There are,  however, limits to who is eligible to use these plans and, for those who are eligible,  limits on the amount that can be put in them.Moreover, because there are penalties  for withdrawal before retirement age, these retirement plans provide little incentive  for other types of saving, such as saving to buy a house or pay for college.A small step to encourage greater saving would be to expand the ability of households  to use such tax-advantaged savings accounts.A more comprehensive approach would be to reconsider the entire basis by  which the government collects revenue.The centerpiece of the U.S. tax system is  the income tax.A dollar earned is taxed the same whether it is spent or saved.An alternative advocated by many economists is a consumption tax.Under a  consumption tax, a household pays taxes only on the basis of what it spends.Income that is saved is exempt from taxation until the saving is later withdrawn   \f 518 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   and spent on consumption goods.In essence, a consumption tax puts all saving  automatically into a tax-advantaged savings account, much like an IRA.A  switch from income to consumption taxation would greatly increase the incentive  to save.CON: THE TAX LAWS SHOULD  NOT BE REFORMED TO ENCOURAGE SAVING   Increasing saving may be desirable, but it is not the only goal of tax policy.Policymakers  also must be sure to distribute the tax burden fairly.The problem with proposals  to increase the incentive to save is that they increase the tax burden on those  who can least afford it.It is an undeniable fact that high-income households save a greater fraction of  their income than low-income households.As a result, any tax change that favors  people who save will also tend to favor people with high income.Policies such  as tax-advantaged retirement accounts may seem appealing, but they lead to a  less egalitarian society.By reducing the tax burden on the wealthy who can take  advantage of these accounts, they force the government to raise the tax burden on  the poor.Moreover, tax policies designed to encourage saving may not be effective at  achieving that goal.Many studies have found that saving is relatively inelastic\u2014  that is, the amount of saving is not very sensitive to the rate of return on saving.If this is indeed the case, then tax provisions that raise the effective return by  reducing the taxation of capital income will further enrich the wealthy without  inducing them to save more than they otherwise would.Economic theory does not give a clear prediction about whether a higher  rate of return would increase saving.The outcome depends on the relative size  of two conflicting effects, called the substitution effect and the income effect.On  the one hand, a higher rate of return raises the benefit of saving: Each dollar  saved today produces more consumption in the future.This substitution effect  tends to raise saving.On the other hand, a higher rate of return lowers the need  for saving: A household has to save less to achieve any target level of consumption  in the future.This income effect tends to reduce saving.If the substitution and  income effects approximately cancel each other, as some studies suggest, then  saving will not change when lower taxation of capital income raises the rate of  return.There are other ways to raise national saving than by giving tax breaks to the  rich.National saving is the sum of private and public saving.Instead of trying to  alter the tax code to encourage greater private saving, policymakers can simply  raise public saving by increasing the budget surplus, perhaps by raising taxes on  the wealthy.This offers a direct way of raising national saving and increasing prosperity  for future generations.Indeed, once public saving is taken into account, tax provisions to encourage  saving might backfire.Tax changes that reduce the taxation of capital income  reduce government revenue and, thereby, lead to a budget deficit.To increase national  saving, such a change in the tax code must stimulate private saving by more  than it reduces public saving.If this is not the case, so-called saving incentives can  potentially make matters worse.CHAPTER 22 FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 519   QUICK QUIZ: Give three examples of how our society discourages saving.What are the drawbacks of eliminating these disincentives?CONCLUSION  This chapter has considered five debates over macroeconomic policy.For each, it  began with a controversial proposition and then offered the arguments pro and  con.If you find it hard to choose a side in these debates, you may find some comfort  in the fact that you are not alone.The study of economics does not always  make it easy to choose among alternative policies.Indeed, by clarifying the inevitable  tradeoffs that policymakers face, it can make the choice more difficult.Difficult choices, however, have no right to seem easy.When you hear politicians  or commentators proposing something that sounds too good to be true, it  probably is.If they sound like they are offering you a free lunch, you should look  for the hidden price tag.Few if any policies come with benefits but no costs.By  helping you see through the fog of rhetoric so common in political discourse, the  study of economics should make you a better participant in our national debates.Summary  Advocates of active monetary and fiscal policy view the  economy as inherently unstable and believe that policy  can manage aggregate demand to offset the inherent  instability.Critics of active monetary and fiscal policy  emphasize that policy affects the economy with a lag  and that our ability to forecast future economic  conditions is poor.As a result, attempts to stabilize the  economy can end up being destabilizing.Advocates of rules for monetary policy argue that  discretionary policy can suffer from incompetence,  abuse of power, and time inconsistency.Critics of rules  for monetary policy argue that discretionary policy is  more flexible in responding to changing economic  circumstances.Advocates of a zero-inflation target emphasize that  inflation has many costs and few if any benefits.Moreover, the cost of eliminating inflation\u2014depressed  output and employment\u2014is only temporary.Even this  cost can be reduced if the central bank announces a  credible plan to reduce inflation, thereby directly  lowering expectations of inflation.Critics of a zero- inflation target claim that moderate inflation imposes  only small costs on society, whereas the recession  necessary to reduce inflation is quite costly.Advocates of reducing the government debt argue that  the debt imposes a burden on future generations by  raising their taxes and lowering their incomes.Critics of  reducing the government debt argue that the debt is  only one small piece of fiscal policy.Single-minded  concern about the debt can obscure the many ways in  which the government\u2019s tax and spending decisions  affect different generations.Advocates of tax incentives for saving point out that our  society discourages saving in many ways, such as by  heavily taxing the income from capital and by reducing  benefits for those who have accumulated wealth.They  endorse reforming the tax laws to encourage saving,  perhaps by switching from an income tax to a  consumption tax.Critics of tax incentives for saving  argue that many proposed changes to stimulate saving  would primarily benefit the wealthy, who do not need a  tax break.They also argue that such changes might have  only a small effect on private saving.Raising public  saving by increasing the government\u2019s budget surplus  would provide a more direct and equitable way to  increase national saving.520 PART NINE FINAL THOUGHTS   Questions for Review  1.What causes the lags in the effect of monetary and fiscal  policy on aggregate demand?What are the implications  of these lags for the debate over active versus passive  policy?What might motivate a central banker to cause a  political business cycle?What does the political business  cycle imply for the debate over policy rules?Explain how credibility might affect the cost of reducing  inflation.Why are some economists against a target of zero  inflation?Explain two ways in which a government budget deficit  hurts a future worker.What are two situations in which most economists view  a budget deficit as justifiable?Give an example of how the government might hurt  young generations, even while reducing the  government debt they inherit.Some economists say that the government can continue  running a budget deficit forever.How is that possible?Some income from capital is taxed twice.Give an example, other than tax policy, of how our  society discourages saving.What adverse effect might be caused by tax incentives  to raise saving?Problems and Applications  1.The chapter suggests that the economy, like the human  body, has \u201cnatural restorative powers.\u201d  a. Illustrate the short-run effect of a fall in aggregate  demand using an aggregate-demand/aggregate- supply diagram.What happens to total output,  income, and employment?If the government does not use stabilization policy,  what happens to the economy over time?Illustrate  on your diagram.Does this adjustment generally  occur in a matter of months or a matter of years?c. Do you think the \u201cnatural restorative powers\u201d of  the economy mean that policymakers should be  passive in response to the business cycle?Policymakers who want to stabilize the economy must  decide how much to change the money supply,  government spending, or taxes.Why is it difficult for  policymakers to choose the appropriate strength of their  actions?Suppose that people suddenly wanted to hold more  money balances.What would be the effect of this change on the  economy if the Federal Reserve followed a rule of  increasing the money supply by 3 percent per year?Illustrate your answer with a money-market  diagram and an aggregate-demand/aggregate- supply diagram.What would be the effect of this change on the  economy if the Fed followed a rule of increasing  the money supply by 3 percent per year plus  1 percentage point for every percentage point  that unemployment rises above its normal level?Illustrate your answer.c. Which of the foregoing rules better stabilizes  the economy?Would it help to allow the Fed to  respond to predicted unemployment instead of  current unemployment?Some economists have proposed that the Fed use the  following rule for choosing its target for the federal  funds interest rate (r):  r 2% p  1/2 (y y*)/y* 1/2 (pp*),   where p  is the average of the inflation rate over the  past year, y is real GDP as recently measured, y* is an  estimate of the natural rate of output, and p* is the Fed\u2019s  goal for inflation.Explain the logic that might lie behind this rule for  setting interest rates.Would you support the Fed\u2019s  use of this rule?Some economists advocate such a rule for monetary  policy but believe p  and y should be the forecasts of  future values of inflation and output.What are the  advantages of using forecasts instead of actual  values?What are the disadvantages?The problem of time inconsistency applies to fiscal  policy as well as to monetary policy.Suppose the  \f CHAPTER 22   government announced a reduction in taxes on income  from capital investments, like new factories.If investors believed that capital taxes would  remain low, how would the government\u2019s action  affect the level of investment?After investors have responded to the announced  tax reduction, does the government have an  incentive to renege on its policy?c. Given your answer to part (b), would investors  believe the government\u2019s announcement?What  can the government do to increase the credibility  of announced policy changes?d. Explain why this situation is similar to the time  inconsistency problem faced by monetary  policymakers.Chapter 2 explains the difference between positive  analysis and normative analysis.In the debate about  whether the central bank should aim for zero inflation,  which areas of disagreement involve positive statements  and which involve normative judgments?Why are the benefits of reducing inflation permanent  and the costs temporary?Why are the costs of  increasing inflation permanent and the benefits  temporary?Use Phillips-curve diagrams in your  answer.Suppose the federal government cuts taxes and  increases spending, raising the budget deficit to  12 percent of GDP.If nominal GDP is rising 7 percent  per year, are such budget deficits sustainable forever?If budget deficits of this size are maintained for  20 years, what is likely to happen to your taxes and your  FIVE DEBATES OVER MACROECONOMIC POLICY 521   children\u2019s taxes in the future?Can you do something  today to offset this future effect?Explain how each of the following policies redistributes  income across generations.Is the redistribution from  young to old, or from old to young?a. an increase in the budget deficit  b. more generous subsidies for education loans  c. greater investments in highways and bridges  d. indexation of Social Security benefits to inflation  10.Surveys suggest that most people are opposed to budget  deficits, but these same people elected representatives  who in the 1980s and 1990s passed budgets with  significant deficits.Why might the opposition to budget  deficits be stronger in principle than in practice?The chapter says that budget deficits reduce the income  of future generations, but can boost output and income  during a recession.Explain how both of these  statements can be true.What is the fundamental tradeoff that society faces if it  chooses to save more?Suppose the government reduced the tax rate on income  from savings.Who would benefit from this tax reduction most  directly?What would happen to the capital stock over time?What would happen to the capital available to each  worker?What would happen to productivity?What would happen to wages?c.

               "context":"TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS   The word economy comes from the Greek word for \u201cone who manages a household.\u201d  At first, this origin might seem peculiar.But, in fact, households and  economies have much in common.A household faces many decisions.It must decide which members of the  household do which tasks and what each member gets in return: Who cooks dinner?Who does the laundry?Who gets the extra dessert at dinner?Who gets to  choose what TV show to watch?In short, the household must allocate its scarce resources  among its various members, taking into account each member\u2019s abilities,  efforts, and desires.Like a household, a society faces many decisions.A society must decide what  jobs will be done and who will do them.It needs some people to grow food, other  people to make clothing, and still others to design computer software.Once society  has allocated people (as well as land, buildings, and machines) to various jobs,   3   IN THIS

reasoning when making decisions   Discuss how  incentives affect  people\u2019s behavior   Consider why trade  among people or  nations can be good  for everyone   Discuss why markets  are a good, but

produce.It must  decide who will eat caviar and who will eat potatoes.It must decide who will  drive a Porsche and who will take the bus.The management of society\u2019s resources is important because resources are  scarcity scarce.Scarcity means that society has limited resources and therefore cannot pro- the limited nature of society\u2019s duce all the goods and services people wish to have.Just as a household cannot  resources give every member everything he or she wants, a society cannot give every indi   vidual the highest standard of living to which he or she might aspire.economics Economics is the study of how society manages its scarce resources.In most  the study of how society manages its societies, resources are allocated not by a single central planner but through the  scarce resources combined actions of millions of households and firms.Economists therefore study   how people make decisions: how much they work, what they buy, how much they  save, and how they invest their savings.Economists also study how people interact  with one another.For instance, they examine how the multitude of buyers and  sellers of a good together determine the price at which the good is sold and the  quantity that is sold.Finally, economists analyze forces and trends that affect  the economy as a whole, including the growth in average income, the fraction of  the population that cannot find work, and the rate at which prices are rising.Although the study of economics has many facets, the field is unified by several  central ideas.In the rest of this chapter, we look at Ten Principles of Economics.These principles recur throughout this book and are introduced here to give you  an overview of what economics is all about.You can think of this chapter as a \u201cpreview  of coming attractions.\u201d   HOW PEOPLE MAKE DECISIONS  There is no mystery to what an \u201ceconomy\u201d is.Whether we are talking about the  economy of Los Angeles, of the United States, or of the whole world, an economy  is just a group of people interacting with one another as they go about their lives.Because the behavior of an economy reflects the behavior of the individuals who  make up the economy, we start our study of economics with four principles of individual  decisionmaking.PRINCIPLE #1: PEOPLE FACE TRADEOFFS   The first lesson about making decisions is summarized in the adage: \u201cThere is no  such thing as a free lunch.\u201d To get one thing that we like, we usually have to give  up another thing that we like.Making decisions requires trading off one goal  against another.Consider a student who must decide how to allocate her most valuable re- source\u2014her time.She can spend all of her time studying economics; she can spend  all of her time studying psychology; or she can divide her time between the two  fields.For every hour she studies one subject, she gives up an hour she could have  used studying the other.And for every hour she spends studying, she gives up an  hour that she could have spent napping, bike riding, watching TV, or working at  her part-time job for some extra spending money.CHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS   Or consider parents deciding how to spend their family income.They can buy  food, clothing, or a family vacation.Or they can save some of the family income  for retirement or the children\u2019s college education.When they choose to spend an  extra dollar on one of these goods, they have one less dollar to spend on some  other good.When people are grouped into societies, they face different kinds of tradeoffs.The classic tradeoff is between \u201cguns and butter.\u201d The more we spend on national  defense to protect our shores from foreign aggressors (guns), the less we can spend  on consumer goods to raise our standard of living at home (butter).Also important  in modern society is the tradeoff between a clean environment and a high level of  income.Laws that require firms to reduce pollution raise the cost of producing  goods and services.Because of the higher costs, these firms end up earning smaller  profits, paying lower wages, charging higher prices, or some combination of these  three.Thus, while pollution regulations give us the benefit of a cleaner environment  and the improved health that comes with it, they have the cost of reducing  the incomes of the firms\u2019 owners, workers, and customers.Another tradeoff society faces is between efficiency and equity.Efficiency  means that society is getting the most it can from its scarce resources.Equity  means that the benefits of those resources are distributed fairly among society\u2019s  members.In other words, efficiency refers to the size of the economic pie, and  equity refers to how the pie is divided.Often, when government policies are being  designed, these two goals conflict.Consider, for instance, policies aimed at achieving a more equal distribution of  economic well-being.Some of these policies, such as the welfare system or unemployment  insurance, try to help those members of society who are most in need.Others, such as the individual income tax, ask the financially successful to contribute  more than others to support the government.Although these policies have  the benefit of achieving greater equity, they have a cost in terms of reduced efficiency.When the government redistributes income from the rich to the poor, it reduces  the reward for working hard; as a result, people work less and produce  fewer goods and services.In other words, when the government tries to cut the  economic pie into more equal slices, the pie gets smaller.Recognizing that people face tradeoffs does not by itself tell us what decisions  they will or should make.A student should not abandon the study of psychology  just because doing so would increase the time available for the study of economics.Society should not stop protecting the environment just because environmental  regulations reduce our material standard of living.The poor should not be  ignored just because helping them distorts work incentives.Nonetheless, acknowledging  life\u2019s tradeoffs is important because people are likely to make good  decisions only if they understand the options that they have available.PRINCIPLE #2: THE COST OF SOMETHING IS  WHAT YOU GIVE UP TO GET IT   Because people face tradeoffs, making decisions requires comparing the costs and  benefits of alternative courses of action.In many cases, however, the cost of some  action is not as obvious as it might first appear.Consider, for example, the decision whether to go to college.The benefit is intellectual  enrichment and a lifetime of better job opportunities.But what is the  cost?To answer this question, you might be tempted to add up the money you   efficiency   the property of society getting the  most it can from its scarce resources   equity   the property of distributing economic  prosperity fairly among the members  of society   PART ONE INTRODUCTION   opportunity cost   whatever must be given up to obtain  some item   marginal changes   small incremental adjustments to a  plan of action   spend on tuition, books, room, and board.Yet this total does not truly represent  what you give up to spend a year in college.The first problem with this answer is that it includes some things that are not  really costs of going to college.Even if you quit school, you would need a place to  sleep and food to eat.Room and board are costs of going to college only to the extent  that they are more expensive at college than elsewhere.Indeed, the cost of  room and board at your school might be less than the rent and food expenses that  you would pay living on your own.In this case, the savings on room and board  are a benefit of going to college.The second problem with this calculation of costs is that it ignores the largest  cost of going to college\u2014your time.When you spend a year listening to lectures,  reading textbooks, and writing papers, you cannot spend that time working at a  job.For most students, the wages given up to attend school are the largest single  cost of their education.The opportunity cost of an item is what you give up to get that item.When  making any decision, such as whether to attend college, decisionmakers should be  aware of the opportunity costs that accompany each possible action.In fact, they  usually are.College-age athletes who can earn millions if they drop out of school  and play professional sports are well aware that their opportunity cost of college  is very high.It is not surprising that they often decide that the benefit is not worth  the cost.PRINCIPLE #3: RATIONAL PEOPLE THINK AT THE MARGIN   Decisions in life are rarely black and white but usually involve shades of gray.When it\u2019s time for dinner, the decision you face is not between fasting or eating  like a pig, but whether to take that extra spoonful of mashed potatoes.When exams  roll around, your decision is not between blowing them off or studying 24  hours a day, but whether to spend an extra hour reviewing your notes instead of  watching TV.Economists use the term marginal changes to describe small incremental  adjustments to an existing plan of action.Keep in mind that \u201cmargin\u201d  means \u201cedge,\u201d so marginal changes are adjustments around the edges of what you  are doing.In many situations, people make the best decisions by thinking at the margin.Suppose, for instance, that you asked a friend for advice about how many years to  stay in school.If he were to compare for you the lifestyle of a person with a Ph.D.  to that of a grade school dropout, you might complain that this comparison is not  helpful for your decision.You have some education already and most likely are  deciding whether to spend an extra year or two in school.To make this decision,  you need to know the additional benefits that an extra year in school would offer  (higher wages throughout life and the sheer joy of learning) and the additional  costs that you would incur (tuition and the forgone wages while you\u2019re in school).By comparing these marginal benefits and marginal costs, you can evaluate whether  the extra year is worthwhile.As another example, consider an airline deciding how much to charge passengers  who fly standby.Suppose that flying a 200-seat plane across the country costs  the airline $100,000.In this case, the average cost of each seat is $100,000/200,  which is $500.One might be tempted to conclude that the airline should never  sell a ticket for less than $500.In fact, however, the airline can raise its profits by   CHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS    thinking at the margin.Imagine that a plane is about to take off with ten empty  seats, and a standby passenger is waiting at the gate willing to pay $300 for a seat.Should the airline sell it to him?Of course it should.If the plane has empty seats,  the cost of adding one more passenger is minuscule.Although the average cost of  flying a passenger is $500, the marginal cost is merely the cost of the bag of peanuts  and can of soda that the extra passenger will consume.As long as the standby passenger  pays more than the marginal cost, selling him a ticket is profitable.As these examples show, individuals and firms can make better decisions by  thinking at the margin.A rational decisionmaker takes an action if and only if the  marginal benefit of the action exceeds the marginal cost.PRINCIPLE #4: PEOPLE RESPOND TO INCENTIVES   Because people make decisions by comparing costs and benefits, their behavior  may change when the costs or benefits change.That is, people respond to incentives.When the price of an apple rises, for instance, people decide to eat more  pears and fewer apples, because the cost of buying an apple is higher.At the same  time, apple orchards decide to hire more workers and harvest more apples, because  the benefit of selling an apple is also higher.As we will see, the effect of price  on the behavior of buyers and sellers in a market\u2014in this case, the market for  apples\u2014is crucial for understanding how the economy works.Public policymakers should never forget about incentives, for many policies  change the costs or benefits that people face and, therefore, alter behavior.A tax on  gasoline, for instance, encourages people to drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.It also encourages people to take public transportation rather than drive and to  live closer to where they work.If the tax were large enough, people would start  driving electric cars.When policymakers fail to consider how their policies affect incentives, they  can end up with results that they did not intend.For example, consider public policy  regarding auto safety.Today all cars have seat belts, but that was not true 40   BASKETBALL STAR KOBE BRYANT   years ago.In the late 1960s, Ralph Nader\u2019s book Unsafe at Any Speed generated UNDERSTANDS OPPORTUNITY COST AND  much public concern over auto safety.Congress responded with laws requiring car INCENTIVES.DESPITE GOOD HIGH SCHOOL   GRADES AND SAT SCORES, HE DECIDED   companies to make various safety features, including seat belts, standard equip-  TO SKIP COLLEGE AND GO STRAIGHT TO   ment on all new cars.THE NBA, WHERE HE EARNED ABOUT   How does a seat belt law affect auto safety?The direct effect is obvious.With   $10 MILLION OVER FOUR YEARS.seat belts in all cars, more people wear seat belts, and the probability of surviving  a major auto accident rises.In this sense, seat belts save lives.But that\u2019s not the end of the story.To fully understand the effects of this law,  we must recognize that people change their behavior in response to the incentives  they face.The relevant behavior here is the speed and care with which drivers operate  their cars.Driving slowly and carefully is costly because it uses the driver\u2019s  time and energy.When deciding how safely to drive, rational people compare the  marginal benefit from safer driving to the marginal cost.They drive more slowly  and carefully when the benefit of increased safety is high.This explains why people  drive more slowly and carefully when roads are icy than when roads are clear.Now consider how a seat belt law alters the cost\u2013benefit calculation of a rational  driver.Seat belts make accidents less costly for a driver because they reduce  the probability of injury or death.Thus, a seat belt law reduces the benefits to slow  and careful driving.People respond to seat belts as they would to an improvement   PART ONE INTRODUCTION   in road conditions\u2014by faster and less careful driving.The end result of a seat belt  law, therefore, is a larger number of accidents.How does the law affect the number of deaths from driving?Drivers who  wear their seat belts are more likely to survive any given accident, but they are also  more likely to find themselves in an accident.The net effect is ambiguous.Moreover,  the reduction in safe driving has an adverse impact on pedestrians (and on  drivers who do not wear their seat belts).They are put in jeopardy by the law because  they are more likely to find themselves in an accident but are not protected  by a seat belt.Thus, a seat belt law tends to increase the number of pedestrian  deaths.At first, this discussion of incentives and seat belts might seem like idle speculation.Yet, in a 1975 study, economist Sam Peltzman showed that the auto-safety  laws have, in fact, had many of these effects.According to Peltzman\u2019s evidence,  these laws produce both fewer deaths per accident and more accidents.The net result  is little change in the number of driver deaths and an increase in the number  of pedestrian deaths.Peltzman\u2019s analysis of auto safety is an example of the general principle that  people respond to incentives.Many incentives that economists study are more  straightforward than those of the auto-safety laws.No one is surprised that people  drive smaller cars in Europe, where gasoline taxes are high, than in the United  States, where gasoline taxes are low.Yet, as the seat belt example shows, policies  can have effects that are not obvious in advance.When analyzing any policy, we  must consider not only the direct effects but also the indirect effects that work  through incentives.If the policy changes incentives, it will cause people to alter  their behavior.QUICK QUIZ: List and briefly explain the four principles of individual   decisionmaking.HOW PEOPLE INTERACT  The first four principles discussed how individuals make decisions.As we  go about our lives, many of our decisions affect not only ourselves but other  people as well.The next three principles concern how people interact with one  another.PRINCIPLE #5: TRADE CAN MAKE EVERYONE BETTER OFF   You have probably heard on the news that the Japanese are our competitors in the  world economy.In some ways, this is true, for American and Japanese firms do  produce many of the same goods.Ford and Toyota compete for the same customers  in the market for automobiles.Compaq and Toshiba compete for the same  customers in the market for personal computers.Yet it is easy to be misled when thinking about competition among countries.Trade between the United States and Japan is not like a sports contest, where one    CHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS    side wins and the other side loses.In fact, the opposite is true: Trade between two  countries can make each country better off.To see why, consider how trade affects your family.When a member of your  family looks for a job, he or she competes against members of other families who  are looking for jobs.Families also compete against one another when they go  shopping, because each family wants to buy the best goods at the lowest prices.So,  in a sense, each family in the economy is competing with all other families.Despite this competition, your family would not be better off isolating itself  from all other families.If it did, your family would need to grow its own food,  make its own clothes, and build its own home.Clearly, your family gains much  from its ability to trade with others.Trade allows each person to specialize in the  activities he or she does best, whether it is farming, sewing, or home building.By  trading with others, people can buy a greater variety of goods and services at  lower cost.Countries as well as families benefit from the ability to trade with one another.Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best and to enjoy a greater variety  of goods and services.The Japanese, as well as the French and the Egyptians  and the Brazilians, are as much our partners in the world economy as they are our   \u201cFor $5 a week you can watch   competitors.baseball without being nagged to  cut the grass!\u201d   PRINCIPLE #6: MARKETS ARE USUALLY A GOOD WAY  TO ORGANIZE ECONOMIC ACTIVITY   The collapse of communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe may be the  most important change in the world during the past half century.Communist  countries worked on the premise that central planners in the government were in  the best position to guide economic activity.These planners decided what goods  and services were produced, how much was produced, and who produced and  consumed these goods and services.The theory behind central planning was that  only the government could organize economic activity in a way that promoted  economic well-being for the country as a whole.Today, most countries that once had centrally planned economies have abandoned  this system and are trying to develop market economies.In a market econ-market economy  omy, the decisions of a central planner are replaced by the decisions of millions of an economy that allocates resources  firms and households.Firms decide whom to hire and what to make.Households through the decentralized decisions  decide which firms to work for and what to buy with their incomes.These firms of many firms and households as  and households interact in the marketplace, where prices and self-interest guide they interact in markets for goods  their decisions.and services   At first glance, the success of market economies is puzzling.After all, in a market  economy, no one is looking out for the economic well-being of society as  a whole.Free markets contain many buyers and sellers of numerous goods and  services, and all of them are interested primarily in their own well-being.Yet,  despite decentralized decisionmaking and self-interested decisionmakers, market  economies have proven remarkably successful in organizing economic activity in  a way that promotes overall economic well-being.In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations,  economist Adam Smith made the most famous observation in all of economics:  Households and firms interacting in markets act as if they are guided by an \u201cinvisible  hand\u201d that leads them to desirable market outcomes.One of our goals in    PART ONE INTRODUCTION   It may be only a coincidence  that Adam Smith\u2019s great book,  An Inquiry into the Nature and  Causes of the Wealth of Na- tions, was published in 1776,  the exact year American revolu- tionaries signed the Declara- tion of Independence.But the  two documents do share a  point of view that was preva- lent at the time\u2014that individu- als are usually best left to their  own devices, without the heavy  hand of government guiding their actions.This political phi- losophy provides the intellectual basis for the market econ- omy, and for free society more generally.Why do decentralized market economies work so  well?Is it because people can be counted on to treat one  another with love and kindness?Not at all.Here is Adam  Smith\u2019s description of how people interact in a market  economy:  Man has almost constant occasion for the help of his  brethren, and it is vain for him to expect it from their  benevolence only.He will be more likely to prevail if he  can interest their self-love in his favor, and show them  that it is for their own advantage to do for him what he  requires of them.It is not from the benevolence of  the butcher, the brewer, or  the baker that we expect our  dinner, but from their regard  to their own interest.Every individual .neither intends to promote  the public interest, nor knows  how much he is promoting  it.He intends only his  own gain, and he is in this, as  in many other cases, led by  an invisible hand to promote  an end which was no part of  his intention.Nor is it always  the worse for the society that  it was no part of it.By pursuing his own interest he  frequently promotes that of the society more effectually  than when he really intends to promote it.Smith is saying that participants in the economy are moti- vated by self-interest and that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the  marketplace guides this self-interest into promoting general  economic well-being.Many of Smith\u2019s insights remain at the center of mod- ern economics.Our analysis in the coming chapters will al- low us to express Smith\u2019s conclusions more precisely and  to analyze fully the strengths and weaknesses of the mar- ket\u2019s invisible hand.ADAM SMITH  FYI  Adam Smith  and the  Invisible Hand  this book is to understand how this invisible hand works its magic.As you study  economics, you will learn that prices are the instrument with which the invisible  hand directs economic activity.Prices reflect both the value of a good to society  and the cost to society of making the good.Because households and firms look at  prices when deciding what to buy and sell, they unknowingly take into account  the social benefits and costs of their actions.As a result, prices guide these individual  decisionmakers to reach outcomes that, in many cases, maximize the welfare  of society as a whole.There is an important corollary to the skill of the invisible hand in guiding economic  activity: When the government prevents prices from adjusting naturally to  supply and demand, it impedes the invisible hand\u2019s ability to coordinate the millions  of households and firms that make up the economy.This corollary explains  why taxes adversely affect the allocation of resources: Taxes distort prices and thus  the decisions of households and firms.It also explains the even greater harm  caused by policies that directly control prices, such as rent control.And it explains  the failure of communism.In communist countries, prices were not determined in  the marketplace but were dictated by central planners.These planners lacked the  information that gets reflected in prices when prices are free to respond to market    CHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS   forces.Central planners failed because they tried to run the economy with one  hand tied behind their backs\u2014the invisible hand of the marketplace.PRINCIPLE #7: GOVERNMENTS CAN SOMETIMES  IMPROVE MARKET OUTCOMES  Although markets are usually a good way to organize economic activity, this rule  has some important exceptions.There are two broad reasons for a government to  intervene in the economy: to promote efficiency and to promote equity.That is,  most policies aim either to enlarge the economic pie or to change how the pie is  divided.The invisible hand usually leads markets to allocate resources efficiently.Nonetheless, for various reasons, the invisible hand sometimes does not work.Economists use the term market failure to refer to a situation in which the market market failure  on its own fails to allocate resources efficiently.a situation in which a market left on  One possible cause of market failure is an externality.An externality is the im-its own fails to allocate resources  pact of one person\u2019s actions on the well-being of a bystander.The classic example efficiently  of an external cost is pollution.If a chemical factory does not bear the entire cost of  the smoke it emits, it will likely emit too much.Here, the government can raise  economic well-being through environmental regulation.The classic example of an  external benefit is the creation of knowledge.When a scientist makes an important  externality  the impact of one person\u2019s actions on  the well-being of a bystander  discovery, he produces a valuable resource that other people can use.In this case,  the government can raise economic well-being by subsidizing basic research, as in  fact it does.Another possible cause of market failure is market power.Market power market power  refers to the ability of a single person (or small group of people) to unduly influ-the ability of a single economic actor  ence market prices.For example, suppose that everyone in town needs water but (or small group of actors) to have a  there is only one well.The owner of the well has market power\u2014in this case a substantial influence on market  monopoly\u2014over the sale of water.The well owner is not subject to the rigorous prices  competition with which the invisible hand normally keeps self-interest in check.You will learn that, in this case, regulating the price that the monopolist charges  can potentially enhance economic efficiency.The invisible hand is even less able to ensure that economic prosperity is distributed  fairly.A market economy rewards people according to their ability to produce  things that other people are willing to pay for.The world\u2019s best basketball  player earns more than the world\u2019s best chess player simply because people are  willing to pay more to watch basketball than chess.The invisible hand does not ensure  that everyone has sufficient food, decent clothing, and adequate health care.A goal of many public policies, such as the income tax and the welfare system, is  to achieve a more equitable distribution of economic well-being.To say that the government can improve on markets outcomes at times does  not mean that it always will.Public policy is made not by angels but by a political  process that is far from perfect.Sometimes policies are designed simply to reward  the politically powerful.Sometimes they are made by well-intentioned leaders  who are not fully informed.One goal of the study of economics is to help you  judge when a government policy is justifiable to promote efficiency or equity and  when it is not.QUICK QUIZ: List and briefly explain the three principles concerning  economic interactions.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   HOW THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE WORKS  productivity   the amount of goods and services  produced from each hour of a  worker\u2019s time   We started by discussing how individuals make decisions and then looked at how  people interact with one another.All these decisions and interactions together  make up \u201cthe economy.\u201d The last three principles concern the workings of the  economy as a whole.PRINCIPLE #8: A COUNTRY\u2019S STANDARD OF  LIVING DEPENDS ON ITS ABILITY TO  PRODUCE GOODS AND SERVICES   The differences in living standards around the world are staggering.In 1997 the  average American had an income of about $29,000.In the same year, the average  Mexican earned $8,000, and the average Nigerian earned $900.Not surprisingly,  this large variation in average income is reflected in various measures of the quality  of life.Citizens of high-income countries have more TV sets, more cars, better  nutrition, better health care, and longer life expectancy than citizens of low-income  countries.Changes in living standards over time are also large.In the United States,  incomes have historically grown about 2 percent per year (after adjusting for  changes in the cost of living).At this rate, average income doubles every 35 years.Over the past century, average income has risen about eightfold.What explains these large differences in living standards among countries and  over time?The answer is surprisingly simple.Almost all variation in living standards  is attributable to differences in countries\u2019 productivity\u2014that is, the amount  of goods and services produced from each hour of a worker\u2019s time.In nations  where workers can produce a large quantity of goods and services per unit of time,  most people enjoy a high standard of living; in nations where workers are less  productive, most people must endure a more meager existence.Similarly, the  growth rate of a nation\u2019s productivity determines the growth rate of its average  income.The fundamental relationship between productivity and living standards is  simple, but its implications are far-reaching.If productivity is the primary determinant  of living standards, other explanations must be of secondary importance.For example, it might be tempting to credit labor unions or minimum-wage laws  for the rise in living standards of American workers over the past century.Yet the  real hero of American workers is their rising productivity.As another example,  some commentators have claimed that increased competition from Japan and  other countries explains the slow growth in U.S. incomes over the past 30 years.Yet the real villain is not competition from abroad but flagging productivity  growth in the United States.The relationship between productivity and living standards also has profound  implications for public policy.When thinking about how any policy will affect living  standards, the key question is how it will affect our ability to produce goods  and services.To boost living standards, policymakers need to raise productivity by  ensuring that workers are well educated, have the tools needed to produce goods  and services, and have access to the best available technology.CHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS   In the 1980s and 1990s, for example, much debate in the United States centered  on the government\u2019s budget deficit\u2014the excess of government spending over government  revenue.As we will see, concern over the budget deficit was based  largely on its adverse impact on productivity.When the government needs to  finance a budget deficit, it does so by borrowing in financial markets, much as a  student might borrow to finance a college education or a firm might borrow to  finance a new factory.As the government borrows to finance its deficit, therefore,  it reduces the quantity of funds available for other borrowers.The budget deficit  thereby reduces investment both in human capital (the student\u2019s education) and  physical capital (the firm\u2019s factory).Because lower investment today means lower  productivity in the future, government budget deficits are generally thought to depress  growth in living standards.PRINCIPLE #9: PRICES RISE WHEN THE  GOVERNMENT PRINTS TOO MUCH MONEY   In Germany in January 1921, a daily newspaper cost 0.30 marks.Less than two  years later, in November 1922, the same newspaper cost 70,000,000 marks.All  other prices in the economy rose by similar amounts.This episode is one of history\u2019s  most spectacular examples of inflation, an increase in the overall level of inflation  prices in the economy.an increase in the overall level of   Although the United States has never experienced inflation even close to that prices in the economy  in Germany in the 1920s, inflation has at times been an economic problem.During  the 1970s, for instance, the overall level of prices more than doubled, and President  Gerald Ford called inflation \u201cpublic enemy number one.\u201d By contrast, inflation in  the 1990s was about 3 percent per year; at this rate it would take more than    \u201cWell it may have been 68 cents when you got in line, but it\u2019s 74 cents now!\u201d   PART ONE INTRODUCTION   20 years for prices to double.Because high inflation imposes various costs on society,  keeping inflation at a low level is a goal of economic policymakers around the  world.What causes inflation?In almost all cases of large or persistent inflation, the  culprit turns out to be the same\u2014growth in the quantity of money.When a government  creates large quantities of the nation\u2019s money, the value of the money  falls.In Germany in the early 1920s, when prices were on average tripling every  month, the quantity of money was also tripling every month.Although less dramatic,  the economic history of the United States points to a similar conclusion: The  high inflation of the 1970s was associated with rapid growth in the quantity of  money, and the low inflation of the 1990s was associated with slow growth in the  quantity of money.PRINCIPLE #10: SOCIETY FACES A SHORT-RUN TRADEOFF  BETWEEN INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT   If inflation is so easy to explain, why do policymakers sometimes have trouble ridding  the economy of it?One reason is that reducing inflation is often thought to  cause a temporary rise in unemployment.The curve that illustrates this tradeoff  Phillips curve between inflation and unemployment is called the Phillips curve, after the econo-  a curve that shows the short-run mist who first examined this relationship.tradeoff between inflation and The Phillips curve remains a controversial topic among economists, but most   unemployment economists today accept the idea that there is a short-run tradeoff between inflation  and unemployment.This simply means that, over a period of a year or two,  many economic policies push inflation and unemployment in opposite directions.Policymakers face this tradeoff regardless of whether inflation and unemployment  both start out at high levels (as they were in the early 1980s), at low levels (as they  were in the late 1990s), or someplace in between.Why do we face this short-run tradeoff?According to a common explanation,  it arises because some prices are slow to adjust.Suppose, for example, that the  government reduces the quantity of money in the economy.In the long run, the  only result of this policy change will be a fall in the overall level of prices.Yet not  all prices will adjust immediately.It may take several years before all firms issue  new catalogs, all unions make wage concessions, and all restaurants print new  menus.That is, prices are said to be sticky in the short run.Because prices are sticky, various types of government policy have short-run  effects that differ from their long-run effects.When the government reduces the  quantity of money, for instance, it reduces the amount that people spend.Lower  spending, together with prices that are stuck too high, reduces the quantity of  goods and services that firms sell.Lower sales, in turn, cause firms to lay off workers.Thus, the reduction in the quantity of money raises unemployment temporarily  until prices have fully adjusted to the change.The tradeoff between inflation and unemployment is only temporary, but it  can last for several years.The Phillips curve is, therefore, crucial for understanding  many developments in the economy.In particular, policymakers can exploit  this tradeoff using various policy instruments.By changing the amount that the  government spends, the amount it taxes, and the amount of money it prints,  policymakers can, in the short run, influence the combination of inflation and  unemployment that the economy experiences.Because these instruments of   CHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS   monetary and fiscal policy are potentially so powerful, how policymakers should  use these instruments to control the economy, if at all, is a subject of continuing  debate.QUICK QUIZ: List and briefly explain the three principles that describe  how the economy as a whole works.CONCLUSION  You now have a taste of what economics is all about.In the coming chapters we  will develop many specific insights about people, markets, and economies.Mastering  these insights will take some effort, but it is not an overwhelming task.The  field of economics is based on a few basic ideas that can be applied in many different  situations.Throughout this book we will refer back to the Ten Principles of Economics  highlighted in this chapter and summarized in Table 1-1.Whenever we do so,  a building-blocks icon will be displayed in the margin, as it is now.But even  when that icon is absent, you should keep these building blocks in mind.Even the  most sophisticated economic analysis is built using the ten principles introduced  here.Table 1-1  TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS  HOW PEOPLE #1: People Face

 in terms of forgone opportunities, that rational people  make decisions by comparing marginal costs and  marginal benefits, and that people change their behavior  in response to the incentives they face.The fundamental lessons about interactions among  people are that trade can be mutually beneficial, that   markets are usually a good way of coordinating trade  among people, and that the government can potentially  improve market outcomes if there is some market  failure or if the market outcome is inequitable.The fundamental lessons about the economy as a whole  are that productivity is the ultimate source of living  standards, that money growth is the ultimate source of  inflation, and that society faces a short-run tradeoff  between inflation and unemployment.Key Concepts

winners and some losers?What does the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the marketplace do?Explain the two main causes of market failure and give  an example of each.Why is productivity important?What is inflation, and what causes it?How are inflation and unemployment related in the  short run?Problems and Applications  1.Describe some of the tradeoffs faced by the following:  a. a family deciding whether to buy a new car  b. a member of Congress deciding how much to  spend on national parks  c. a company president deciding whether to open a  new factory  d. a professor deciding how much to prepare for class  2.You are trying to decide whether to take a vacation.Most of the costs of the vacation (airfare, hotel, forgone  wages) are measured in dollars, but the benefits of the  vacation are psychological.How can you compare the  benefits to the costs?You were planning to spend Saturday working at your  part-time job, but a friend asks you to go skiing.What  is the true cost of going skiing?Now suppose that you  had been planning to spend the day studying at the  library.What is the cost of going skiing in this case?You win $100 in a basketball pool.You have a choice  between spending the money now or putting it away  for a year in a bank account that pays 5 percent interest.What is the opportunity cost of spending the $100 now?The company that you manage has invested $5 million  in developing a new product, but the development is  not quite finished.At a recent meeting, your salespeople  report that the introduction of competing products has  reduced the expected sales of your new product to  $3 million.If it would cost $1 million to finish  CHAPTER 1 TEN PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS   development and make the product, should you go  ahead and do so?What is the most that you should pay  to complete development?Three managers of the Magic Potion Company are  discussing a possible increase in production.Each  suggests a way to make this decision.HARRY: We should examine whether our  company\u2019s productivity\u2014gallons of  potion per worker\u2014would rise or fall.RON: We should examine whether our average  cost\u2014cost per worker\u2014would rise or fall.HERMIONE: We should examine whether the extra  revenue from selling the additional potion  would be greater or smaller than the extra  costs.Who do you think is right?The Social Security system provides income for people  over age 65.If a recipient of Social Security decides to  work and earn some income, the amount he or she  receives in Social Security benefits is typically reduced.How does the provision of Social Security affect  people\u2019s incentive to save while working?How does the reduction in benefits associated with  higher earnings affect people\u2019s incentive to work  past age 65?A recent bill reforming the government\u2019s antipoverty  programs limited many welfare recipients to only two  years of benefits.How does this change affect the incentives for  working?How might this change represent a tradeoff  between equity and efficiency?Your roommate is a better cook than you are, but you  can clean more quickly than your roommate can.If your  roommate did all of the cooking and you did all of the  cleaning, would your chores take you more or less time  than if you divided each task evenly?Give a similar  example of how specialization and trade can make two  countries both better off.Suppose the United States adopted central planning for  its economy, and you became the chief planner.Among  the millions of decisions that you need to make for next  year are how many compact discs to produce, what  artists to record, and who should receive the discs.To make these decisions intelligently, what  information would you need about the compact  disc industry?What information would you need  about each of the people in the United States?How would your decisions about CDs affect some  of your other decisions, such as how many CD  players to make or cassette tapes to produce?How  might some of your other decisions about the  economy change your views about CDs?Explain whether each of the following government  activities is motivated by a concern about equity or a  concern about efficiency.In the case of efficiency, discuss  the type of market failure involved.a. regulating cable-TV prices  b. providing some poor people with vouchers that can  be used to buy food  c. prohibiting smoking in public places  d. breaking up Standard Oil (which once owned  90 percent of all oil refineries) into several smaller  companies  e. imposing higher personal income tax rates on  people with higher incomes  f. instituting laws against driving while intoxicated  12.Discuss each of the following statements from the  standpoints of equity and efficiency.\u201cEveryone in society should be guaranteed the best  health care possible.\u201d  b.\u201cWhen workers are laid off, they should be able to  collect unemployment benefits until they find a  new job.\u201d  13.In what ways is your standard of living different from  that of your parents or grandparents when they were  your age?Why have these changes occurred?Suppose Americans decide to save more of their  incomes.If banks lend this extra saving to businesses,  which use the funds to build new factories, how might  this lead to faster growth in productivity?Who do you  suppose benefits from the higher productivity?Is  society getting a free lunch?Suppose that when everyone wakes up tomorrow, they  discover that the government has given them an  additional amount of money equal to the amount they  already had.Explain what effect this doubling of the  money supply will likely have on the following:  a. the total amount spent on goods and services  b. the quantity of goods and services purchased if  prices are sticky  c. the prices of goods and services if prices can adjust  16.Imagine that you are a policymaker trying to decide  whether to reduce the rate of inflation.To make an  intelligent decision, what would you need to know  about inflation, unemployment, and the tradeoff  between them?",

               "context":"THINKING LIKE  AN ECONOMIST   Every field of study has its own language and its own way of thinking.Mathematicians  talk about axioms, integrals, and vector spaces.Psychologists talk about  ego, id, and cognitive dissonance.Lawyers talk about venue, torts, and promissory  estoppel.Economics is no different.Supply, demand, elasticity, comparative advantage,  consumer surplus, deadweight loss\u2014these terms are part of the economist\u2019s language.In the coming chapters, you will encounter many new terms and some familiar  words that economists use in specialized ways.At first, this new language  may seem needlessly arcane.But, as you will see, its value lies in its ability to provide  you a new and useful way of thinking about the world in which you live.The single most important purpose of this book is to help you learn the economist\u2019s  way of thinking.Of course, just as you cannot become a mathematician,  psychologist, or lawyer overnight, learning to think like an economist will take   19   IN THIS CHAPTER  YOU WILL .See how economists  apply the methods  of science   Consider how  assumptions and

some time.Yet with a combination of theory, case studies, and examples of economics  in the news, this book will give you ample opportunity to develop and  practice this skill.Before delving into the substance and details of economics, it is helpful to have  an overview of how economists approach the world.This chapter, therefore, discusses  the field\u2019s methodology.What is distinctive about how economists confront  a question?What does it mean to think like an economist?THE ECONOMIST AS SCIENTIST  Economists try to address their subject with a scientist\u2019s objectivity.They approach  the study of the economy in much the same way as a physicist approaches the  study of matter and a biologist approaches the study of life: They devise theories,  collect data, and then analyze these data in an attempt to verify or refute their  theories.To beginners, it can seem odd to claim that economics is a science.After  all, economists do not work with test tubes or telescopes.The essence of science,    \u201cI\u2019m a social scientist, Michael.That means I can\u2019t explain  electricity or anything like that, but if you ever want to know  about people I\u2019m your man.\u201d   \f CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   however, is the scientific method\u2014the dispassionate development and testing of  theories about how the world works.This method of inquiry is as applicable to  studying a nation\u2019s economy as it is to studying the earth\u2019s gravity or a species\u2019  evolution.As Albert Einstein once put it, \u201cThe whole of science is nothing more  than the refinement of everyday thinking.\u201d   Although Einstein\u2019s comment is as true for social sciences such as economics  as it is for natural sciences such as physics, most people are not accustomed to  looking at society through the eyes of a scientist.Let\u2019s therefore discuss some of  the ways in which economists apply the logic of science to examine how an economy  works.THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD: OBSERVATION,  THEORY, AND MORE OBSERVATION   Isaac Newton, the famous seventeenth-century scientist and mathematician, allegedly  became intrigued one day when he saw an apple fall from an apple tree.This observation motivated Newton to develop a theory of gravity that applies not  only to an apple falling to the earth but to any two objects in the universe.Subsequent  testing of Newton\u2019s theory has shown that it works well in many circumstances  (although, as Einstein would later emphasize, not in all circumstances).Because Newton\u2019s theory has been so successful at explaining observation, it is  still taught today in undergraduate physics courses around the world.This interplay between theory and observation also occurs in the field of economics.An economist might live in a country experiencing rapid increases in  prices and be moved by this observation to develop a theory of inflation.The  theory might assert that high inflation arises when the government prints too   much money.(As you may recall, this was one of the Ten Principles of Economics in  Chapter 1.)To test this theory, the economist could collect and analyze data on  prices and money from many different countries.If growth in the quantity of  money were not at all related to the rate at which prices are rising, the economist  would start to doubt the validity of his theory of inflation.If money growth and inflation  were strongly correlated in international data, as in fact they are, the economist  would become more confident in his theory.Although economists use theory and observation like other scientists, they do  face an obstacle that makes their task especially challenging: Experiments are often  difficult in economics.Physicists studying gravity can drop many objects in their  laboratories to generate data to test their theories.By contrast, economists studying  inflation are not allowed to manipulate a nation\u2019s monetary policy simply to  generate useful data.Economists, like astronomers and evolutionary biologists,  usually have to make do with whatever data the world happens to give them.To find a substitute for laboratory experiments, economists pay close attention  to the natural experiments offered by history.When a war in the Middle East interrupts  the flow of crude oil, for instance, oil prices skyrocket around the world.For consumers of oil and oil products, such an event depresses living standards.For economic policymakers, it poses a difficult choice about how best to respond.But for economic scientists, it provides an opportunity to study the effects of a key  natural resource on the world\u2019s economies, and this opportunity persists long after  the wartime increase in oil prices is over.Throughout this book, therefore, we consider  many historical episodes.These episodes are valuable to study because they    \f PART ONE INTRODUCTION   give us insight into the economy of the past and, more important, because they allow  us to illustrate and evaluate economic theories of the present.THE ROLE OF ASSUMPTIONS   If you ask a physicist how long it would take for a marble to fall from the top of a  ten-story building, she will answer the question by assuming that the marble falls  in a vacuum.Of course, this assumption is false.In fact, the building is surrounded  by air, which exerts friction on the falling marble and slows it down.Yet the physicist  will correctly point out that friction on the marble is so small that its effect is  negligible.Assuming the marble falls in a vacuum greatly simplifies the problem  without substantially affecting the answer.Economists make assumptions for the same reason: Assumptions can make  the world easier to understand.To study the effects of international trade, for example,  we may assume that the world consists of only two countries and that each  country produces only two goods.Of course, the real world consists of dozens of  countries, each of which produces thousands of different types of goods.But by assuming  two countries and two goods, we can focus our thinking.Once we understand  international trade in an imaginary world with two countries and two  goods, we are in a better position to understand international trade in the more  complex world in which we live.The art in scientific thinking\u2014whether in physics, biology, or economics\u2014is  deciding which assumptions to make.Suppose, for instance, that we were dropping  a beach ball rather than a marble from the top of the building.Our physicist  would realize that the assumption of no friction is far less accurate in this case:  Friction exerts a greater force on a beach ball than on a marble.The assumption  that gravity works in a vacuum is reasonable for studying a falling marble but not  for studying a falling beach ball.Similarly, economists use different assumptions to answer different questions.Suppose that we want to study what happens to the economy when the government  changes the number of dollars in circulation.An important piece of this  analysis, it turns out, is how prices respond.Many prices in the economy change  infrequently; the newsstand prices of magazines, for instance, are changed only  every few years.Knowing this fact may lead us to make different assumptions  when studying the effects of the policy change over different time horizons.For  studying the short-run effects of the policy, we may assume that prices do not  change much.We may even make the extreme and artificial assumption that all  prices are completely fixed.For studying the long-run effects of the policy, however,  we may assume that all prices are completely flexible.Just as a physicist uses  different assumptions when studying falling marbles and falling beach balls, economists  use different assumptions when studying the short-run and long-run effects  of a change in the quantity of money.ECONOMIC MODELS   High school biology teachers teach basic anatomy with plastic replicas of the human  body.These models have all the major organs\u2014the heart, the liver, the kidneys,  and so on.The models allow teachers to show their students in a simple way  how the important parts of the body fit together.Of course, these plastic models   \f CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   are not actual human bodies, and no one would mistake the model for a real person.These models are stylized, and they omit many details.Yet despite this lack of  realism\u2014indeed, because of this lack of realism\u2014studying these models is useful  for learning how the human body works.Economists also use models to learn about the world, but instead of being  made of plastic, they are most often composed of diagrams and equations.Like  a biology teacher\u2019s plastic model, economic models omit many details to allow  us to see what is truly important.Just as the biology teacher\u2019s model does not include  all of the body\u2019s muscles and capillaries, an economist\u2019s model does not  include every feature of the economy.As we use models to examine various economic issues throughout this book,  you will see that all the models are built with assumptions.Just as a physicist begins  the analysis of a falling marble by assuming away the existence of friction,  economists assume away many of the details of the economy that are irrelevant for  studying the question at hand.All models\u2014in physics, biology, or economics\u2014  simplify reality in order to improve our understanding of it.OUR FIRST MODEL: THE CIRCULAR-FLOW DIAGRAM   The economy consists of millions of people engaged in many activities\u2014buying,  selling, working, hiring, manufacturing, and so on.To understand how the economy  works, we must find some way to simplify our thinking about all these activities.In other words, we need a model that explains, in general terms, how the  economy is organized and how participants in the economy interact with one  another.Figure 2-1 presents a visual model of the economy, called a circular-flow circular-flow diagram  diagram.In this model, the economy has two types of decisionmakers\u2014house-a visual model of the economy that  holds and firms.Firms produce goods and services using inputs, such as labor, shows how dollars flow through  land, and capital (buildings and machines).These inputs are called the factors of markets among households and firms  production.Households own the factors of production and consume all the goods  and services that the firms produce.Households and firms interact in two types of markets.In the markets for  goods and services, households are buyers and firms are sellers.In particular,  households buy the output of goods and services that firms produce.In the markets  for the factors of production, households are sellers and firms are buyers.In  these markets, households provide firms the inputs that the firms use to produce  goods and services.The circular-flow diagram offers a simple way of organizing  all the economic transactions that occur between households and firms in the  economy.The inner loop of the circular-flow diagram represents the flows of goods and  services between households and firms.The households sell the use of their labor,  land, and capital to the firms in the markets for the factors of production.The firms  then use these factors to produce goods and services, which in turn are sold  to households in the markets for goods and services.Hence, the factors of production  flow from households to firms, and goods and services flow from firms to  households.The outer loop of the circular-flow diagram represents the corresponding flow  of dollars.The households spend money to buy goods and services from the  firms.The firms use some of the revenue from these sales to pay for the factors of   \f PART ONE INTRODUCTION   Figure 2-1  THE CIRCULAR FLOW.This  diagram is a schematic representation  of the organization of the  economy.Decisions are made by  households and firms.Households  and firms interact in the  markets for goods and services  (where households are buyers  and firms are sellers) and in the  markets for the factors of  production (where firms are  buyers and households are  sellers).The outer set of arrows  shows the flow of dollars, and the  inner set of arrows shows the  corresponding flow of goods and  services.Spending  Goods and  services  bought  Revenue  Goods  and services  sold  Labor, land,  and capital  Income  Flow of goods

MARKETS  FOR  GOODS AND SERVICES  production, such as the wages of their workers.What\u2019s left is the profit of the firm  owners, who themselves are members of households.Hence, spending on goods  and services flows from households to firms, and income in the form of wages,  rent, and profit flows from firms to households.Let\u2019s take a tour of the circular flow by following a dollar bill as it makes its  way from person to person through the economy.Imagine that the dollar begins at  a household, sitting in, say, your wallet.If you want to buy a cup of coffee, you  take the dollar to one of the economy\u2019s markets for goods and services, such as  your local Starbucks coffee shop.There you spend it on your favorite drink.When  the dollar moves into the Starbucks cash register, it becomes revenue for the firm.The dollar doesn\u2019t stay at Starbucks for long, however, because the firm uses it to  buy inputs in the markets for the factors of production.For instance, Starbucks  might use the dollar to pay rent to its landlord for the space it occupies or to pay  the wages of its workers.In either case, the dollar enters the income of some  household and, once again, is back in someone\u2019s wallet.At that point, the story of  the economy\u2019s circular flow starts once again.The circular-flow diagram in Figure 2-1 is one simple model of the economy.It  dispenses with details that, for some purposes, are significant.A more complex   \f CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   and realistic circular-flow model would include, for instance, the roles of government  and international trade.Yet these details are not crucial for a basic understanding  of how the economy is organized.Because of its simplicity, this  circular-flow diagram is useful to keep in mind when thinking about how the  pieces of the economy fit together.OUR SECOND MODEL: THE PRODUCTION  POSSIBILITIES FRONTIER   Most economic models, unlike the circular-flow diagram, are built using the tools  of mathematics.Here we consider one of the simplest such models, called the production  possibilities frontier, and see how this model illustrates some basic economic  ideas.Although real economies produce thousands of goods and services, let\u2019s imagine  an economy that produces only two goods\u2014cars and computers.Together the  car industry and the computer industry use all of the economy\u2019s factors of production.The production possibilities frontier is a graph that shows the various production possibilities  combinations of output\u2014in this case, cars and computers\u2014that the economy can frontier  possibly produce given the available factors of production and the available pro-a graph that shows the combinations  duction technology that firms can use to turn these factors into output.of output that the economy can   Figure 2-2 is an example of a production possibilities frontier.In this economy, possibly produce given the available  if all resources were used in the car industry, the economy would produce 1,000 factors of production and the  cars and no computers.If all resources were used in the computer industry, the available production technology  economy would produce 3,000 computers and no cars.The two end points of  the production possibilities frontier represent these extreme possibilities.If the   1,000  2,200

FRONTIER.The production  possibilities frontier shows the  combinations of output\u2014in this  case, cars and computers\u2014that  the economy can possibly  produce.The economy can  produce any combination on or  inside the frontier.Points outside  the frontier are not feasible given  the economy\u2019s resources.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   economy were to divide its resources between the two industries, it could produce  700 cars and 2,000 computers, shown in the figure by point A.By contrast, the outcome  at point D is not possible because resources are scarce: The economy does  not have enough of the factors of production to support that level of output.In  other words, the economy can produce at any point on or inside the production  possibilities frontier, but it cannot produce at points outside the frontier.An outcome is said to be efficient if the economy is getting all it can from the  scarce resources it has available.Points on (rather than inside) the production possibilities  frontier represent efficient levels of production.When the economy is producing  at such a point, say point A, there is no way to produce more of one good  without producing less of the other.Point B represents an inefficient outcome.For  some reason, perhaps widespread unemployment, the economy is producing less  than it could from the resources it has available: It is producing only 300 cars and  1,000 computers.If the source of the inefficiency were eliminated, the economy  could move from point B to point A, increasing production of both cars (to 700)  and computers (to 2,000).One of the Ten Principles of Economics discussed in Chapter 1 is that people face  tradeoffs.The production possibilities frontier shows one tradeoff that society  faces.Once we have reached the efficient points on the frontier, the only way of  getting more of one good is to get less of the other.When the economy moves from  point A to point C, for instance, society produces more computers but at the expense  of producing fewer cars.Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that the cost of something is what  you give up to get it.This is called the opportunity cost.The production possibilities  frontier shows the opportunity cost of one good as measured in terms of the other  good.When society reallocates some of the factors of production from the car industry  to the computer industry, moving the economy from point A to point C, it  gives up 100 cars to get 200 additional computers.In other words, when the economy  is at point A, the opportunity cost of 200 computers is 100 cars.Notice that the production possibilities frontier in Figure 2-2 is bowed outward.This means that the opportunity cost of cars in terms of computers depends  on how much of each good the economy is producing.When the economy is using  most of its resources to make cars, the production possibilities frontier is quite  steep.Because even workers and machines best suited to making computers are  being used to make cars, the economy gets a substantial increase in the number of  computers for each car it gives up.By contrast, when the economy is using most of  its resources to make computers, the production possibilities frontier is quite flat.In this case, the resources best suited to making computers are already in the computer  industry, and each car the economy gives up yields only a small increase in  the number of computers.The production possibilities frontier shows the tradeoff between the production  of different goods at a given time, but the tradeoff can change over time.For  example, if a technological advance in the computer industry raises the number of  computers that a worker can produce per week, the economy can make more computers  for any given number of cars.As a result, the production possibilities frontier  shifts outward, as in Figure 2-3.Because of this economic growth, society  might move production from point A to point E, enjoying more computers and  more cars.The production possibilities frontier simplifies a complex economy to highlight  and clarify some basic ideas.We have used it to illustrate some of the   \f CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   Figure 2-3  2,100  2,000  A  E  Quantity of  Cars Produced  700 750 0  4,000  3,000  1,000  Quantity of  Computers  Produced  concepts mentioned briefly in Chapter 1: scarcity, efficiency, tradeoffs, opportunity  cost, and economic growth.As you study economics, these ideas will recur in  various forms.The production possibilities frontier offers one simple way of thinking  about them.MICROECONOMICS AND MACROECONOMICS   Many subjects are studied on various levels.Consider biology, for example.Molecular  biologists study the chemical compounds that make up living things.Cellular  biologists study cells, which are made up of many chemical compounds and, at  the same time, are themselves the building blocks of living organisms.Evolutionary  biologists study the many varieties of animals and plants and how species  change gradually over the centuries.Economics is also studied on various levels.We can study the decisions of individual  households and firms.Or we can study the interaction of households and  firms in markets for specific goods and services.Or we can study the operation of  the economy as a whole, which is just the sum of the activities of all these decision- makers in all these markets.The field of economics is traditionally divided into two broad subfields.Microeconomics is the study of how households and firms make decisions and  how they interact in specific markets.Macroeconomics is the study of economy- wide phenomena.A microeconomist might study the effects of rent control on  housing in New York City, the impact of foreign competition on the U.S. auto industry,  or the effects of compulsory school attendance on workers\u2019 earnings.A   ASHIFT IN THE PRODUCTION  POSSIBILITIES FRONTIER.An  economic advance in the  computer industry shifts the  production possibilities frontier  outward, increasing the number  of cars and computers the  economy can produce.microeconomics   the study of how households and  firms make decisions and how they  interact in markets   macroeconomics   the study of economy-wide  phenomena, including inflation,  unemployment, and economic  growth   \f PART ONE INTRODUCTION   macroeconomist might study the effects of borrowing by the federal government,  the changes over time in the economy\u2019s rate of unemployment, or alternative policies  to raise growth in national living standards.Microeconomics and macroeconomics are closely intertwined.Because  changes in the overall economy arise from the decisions of millions of individuals,  it is impossible to understand macroeconomic developments without considering  the associated microeconomic decisions.For example, a macroeconomist might  study the effect of a cut in the federal income tax on the overall production of  goods and services.To analyze this issue, he or she must consider how the tax  cut affects the decisions of households about how much to spend on goods and  services.Despite the inherent link between microeconomics and macroeconomics, the  two fields are distinct.In economics, as in biology, it may seem natural to begin  with the smallest unit and build up.Yet doing so is neither necessary nor always  the best way to proceed.Evolutionary biology is, in a sense, built upon molecular  biology, since species are made up of molecules.Yet molecular biology and evolutionary  biology are separate fields, each with its own questions and its own methods.Similarly, because microeconomics and macroeconomics address different  questions, they sometimes take quite different approaches and are often taught in  separate courses.QUICK QUIZ: In what sense is economics like a science?Draw a  production possibilities frontier for a society that produces food and clothing.Show an efficient point, an inefficient point, and an infeasible point.Show the  effects of a drought.Define microeconomics and macroeconomics.THE ECONOMIST AS POLICY ADVISER  Often economists are asked to explain the causes of economic events.Why, for example,  is unemployment higher for teenagers than for older workers?Sometimes  economists are asked to recommend policies to improve economic outcomes.What, for instance, should the government do to improve the economic well-being  of teenagers?When economists are trying to explain the world, they are scientists.When they are trying to help improve it, they are policy advisers.POSITIVE VERSUS NORMATIVE ANALYSIS   To help clarify the two roles that economists play, we begin by examining the use  of language.Because scientists and policy advisers have different goals, they use  language in different ways.For example, suppose that two people are discussing minimum-wage laws.Here are two statements you might hear:   POLLY: Minimum-wage laws cause unemployment.NORMA: The government should raise the minimum wage.CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   Ignoring for now whether you agree with these statements, notice that Polly and  Norma differ in what they are trying to do.Polly is speaking like a scientist: She is  making a claim about how the world works.Norma is speaking like a policy adviser:  She is making a claim about how she would like to change the world.In general, statements about the world are of two types.One type, such as  Polly\u2019s, is positive.Positive statements are descriptive.They make a claim about  how the world is.A second type of statement, such as Norma\u2019s, is normative.Normative  statements are prescriptive.They make a claim about how the world ought  to be.A key difference between positive and normative statements is how we judge  their validity.We can, in principle, confirm or refute positive statements by examining  evidence.An economist might evaluate Polly\u2019s statement by analyzing data  on changes in minimum wages and changes in unemployment over time.By contrast,  evaluating normative statements involves values as well as facts.Norma\u2019s  statement cannot be judged using data alone.Deciding what is good or bad policy  is not merely a matter of science.It also involves our views on ethics, religion, and  political philosophy.Of course, positive and normative statements may be related.Our positive  views about how the world works affect our normative views about what policies  are desirable.Polly\u2019s claim that the minimum wage causes unemployment, if true,  might lead us to reject Norma\u2019s conclusion that the government should raise the  minimum wage.Yet our normative conclusions cannot come from positive analysis  alone.Instead, they require both positive analysis and value judgments.As you study economics, keep in mind the distinction between positive and  normative statements.Much of economics just tries to explain how the economy  works.Yet often the goal of economics is to improve how the economy works.When you hear economists making normative statements, you know they have  crossed the line from scientist to policy adviser.ECONOMISTS IN WASHINGTON   President Harry Truman once said that he wanted to find a one-armed economist.When he asked his economists for advice, they always answered, \u201cOn the one  hand, .On the other hand, ..\u201d   Truman was right in realizing that economists\u2019 advice is not always straightforward.This tendency is rooted in one of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter  1: People face tradeoffs.Economists are aware that tradeoffs are involved in  most policy decisions.A policy might increase efficiency at the cost of equity.It  might help future generations but hurt current generations.An economist who  says that all policy decisions are easy is an economist not to be trusted.Truman was also not alone among presidents in relying on the advice of economists.Since 1946, the president of the United States has received guidance from  the Council of Economic Advisers, which consists of three members and a staff of  several dozen economists.The council, whose offices are just a few steps from the  White House, has no duty other than to advise the president and to write the annual  Economic Report of the President.The president also receives input from economists in many administrative departments.Economists at the Department of Treasury help design tax policy.Economists  at the Department of Labor analyze data on workers and those looking for   positive statements   claims that attempt to describe the  world as it is   normative statements   claims that attempt to prescribe how  the world should be    \f PART ONE INTRODUCTION

antitrust laws.Economists are also found outside the administrative branch of government.To obtain independent evaluations of policy proposals, Congress relies on the advice  of the Congressional Budget Office, which is staffed by economists.The Federal  Reserve, the quasi-governmental institution that sets the nation\u2019s monetary  policy, employs hundreds of economists to analyze economic developments in the  United States and throughout the world.Table 2-1 lists the Web sites of some of  these agencies.The influence of economists on policy goes beyond their role as advisers: Their  research and writings often affect policy indirectly.Economist John Maynard  Keynes offered this observation:   The ideas of economists and political philosophers, both when they are right and  when they are wrong, are more powerful than is commonly understood.Indeed,  the world is ruled by little else.Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite  exempt from intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct  economist.Madmen in authority, who hear voices in the air, are distilling their  frenzy from some academic scribbler of a few years back.Department of Commerce

words were written in 1935, they remain true today.Indeed, the  \u201cacademic scribbler\u201d now influencing public policy is often Keynes himself.QUICK QUIZ: Give an example of a positive statement and an example of a  normative statement.Name three parts of government that regularly rely  on advice from economists.WHY ECONOMISTS DISAGREE  \u201cIf all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion.\u201d This  quip from George Bernard Shaw is revealing.Economists as a group are often criticized  for giving conflicting advice to policymakers.President Ronald Reagan once  joked that if the game Trivial Pursuit were designed for economists, it would have  100 questions and 3,000 answers.Why do economists so often appear to give conflicting advice to policymakers?There are two basic reasons:     Economists may disagree about the validity of alternative positive theories   about how the world works.Economists may have different values and, therefore, different normative   views about what policy should try to accomplish.Let\u2019s discuss each of these reasons.DIFFERENCES IN SCIENTIFIC JUDGMENTS   Several centuries ago, astronomers debated whether the earth or the sun was at the  center of the solar system.More recently, meteorologists have debated whether  the earth is experiencing \u201cglobal warming\u201d and, if so, why.Science is a search for  understanding about the world around us.It is not surprising that as the search  continues, scientists can disagree about the direction in which truth lies.Economists often disagree for the same reason.Economics is a young science,  and there is still much to be learned.Economists sometimes disagree because they  have different hunches about the validity of alternative theories or about the size  of important parameters.For example, economists disagree about whether the government should levy  taxes based on a household\u2019s income or its consumption (spending).Advocates of  a switch from the current income tax to a consumption tax believe that the change  would encourage households to save more, because income that is saved would  not be taxed.Higher saving, in turn, would lead to more rapid growth in productivity  and living standards.Advocates of the current income tax believe that  household saving would not respond much to a change in the tax laws.These  two groups of economists hold different normative views about the tax system  because they have different positive views about the responsiveness of saving to  tax incentives.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   DIFFERENCES IN VALUES   Suppose that Peter and Paul both take the same amount of water from the town  well.To pay for maintaining the well, the town taxes its residents.Peter has income  of $50,000 and is taxed $5,000, or 10 percent of his income.Paul has income  of $10,000 and is taxed $2,000, or 20 percent of his income.Is this policy fair?If not, who pays too much and who pays too little?Does it  matter whether Paul\u2019s low income is due to a medical disability or to his decision  to pursue a career in acting?Does it matter whether Peter\u2019s high income is due to  a large inheritance or to his willingness to work long hours at a dreary job?These are difficult questions on which people are likely to disagree.If the town   hired two experts to study how the town should tax its residents to pay for the   well, we would not be surprised if they offered conflicting advice.This simple example shows why economists sometimes disagree about public  policy.As we learned earlier in our discussion of normative and positive analysis,  policies cannot be judged on scientific grounds alone.Economists give conflicting  advice sometimes because they have different values.Perfecting the science of economics  will not tell us whether it is Peter or Paul who pays too much.PERCEPTION VERSUS REALITY   Because of differences in scientific judgments and differences in values,  some disagreement among economists is inevitable.Yet one should not overstate  the amount of disagreement.In many cases, economists do offer a united  view.Table 2-2 contains ten propositions about economic policy.In a survey of  economists in business, government, and academia, these propositions were endorsed  by an overwhelming majority of respondents.Most of these propositions  would fail to command a similar consensus among the general public.The first proposition in the table is about rent control.For reasons we will discuss  in Chapter 6, almost all economists believe that rent control adversely affects  the availability and quality of housing and is a very costly way of helping the most  needy members of society.Nonetheless, many city governments choose to ignore  the advice of economists and place ceilings on the rents that landlords may charge  their tenants.The second proposition in the table concerns tariffs and import quotas.For  reasons we will discuss in Chapter 3 and more fully in Chapter 9, almost all economists  oppose such barriers to free trade.Nonetheless, over the years, the president  and Congress have chosen to restrict the import of certain goods.In 1993 the  North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which reduced barriers to trade  among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, passed Congress, but only by a  narrow margin, despite overwhelming support from economists.In this case,  economists did offer united advice, but many members of Congress chose to ignore  it.Why do policies such as rent control and import quotas persist if the experts  are united in their opposition?The reason may be that economists have not yet  convinced the general public that these policies are undesirable.One purpose of  this book is to make you understand the economist\u2019s view of these and other subjects  and, perhaps, to persuade you that it is the right one.CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   Table 2-2  PROPOSITION (AND PERCENTAGE

sold, the cost of growing bananas, and so  on.Often these economic variables are related to one another.When the price of  bananas rises, people buy fewer bananas.One way of expressing the relationships  among variables is with graphs.Graphs serve two purposes.First, when developing economic theories, graphs  offer a way to visually express ideas that might be less clear if described with  equations or words.Second, when analyzing economic data, graphs provide a  way of finding how variables are in fact related in the world.Whether we are  working with theory or with data, graphs provide a lens through which a recognizable  forest emerges from a multitude of trees.Numerical information can be expressed graphically in many ways, just as a  thought can be expressed in words in many ways.A good writer chooses words  that will make an argument clear, a description pleasing, or a scene dramatic.An  effective economist chooses the type of graph that best suits the purpose at hand.In this appendix we discuss how economists use graphs to study the mathematical  relationships among variables.We also discuss some of the pitfalls that can  arise in the use of graphical methods.GRAPHS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE   Three common graphs are shown in Figure 2A-1.The pie chart in panel (a) shows  how total income in the United States is divided among the sources of income, including  compensation of employees, corporate profits, and so on.A slice of the pie  represents each source\u2019s share of the total.The bar graph in panel (b) compares a  measure of average income, called real GDP per person, for four countries.The  height of each bar represents the average income in each country.The time-series  graph in panel (c) traces the rising productivity in the

COORDINATE SYSTEM   Although the three graphs in Figure 2A-1 are useful in showing how a variable  changes over time or across individuals, such graphs are limited in how much  they can tell us.These graphs display information only on a single variable.Economists  are often concerned with the relationships between variables.Thus, they  need to be able to display two variables on a single graph.The coordinate system  makes this possible.Suppose you want to examine the relationship between study time and grade  point average.For each student in your class, you could record a pair of numbers:  hours per week spent studying and grade point average.These numbers could  then be placed in parentheses as an ordered pair and appear as a single point on the  graph.Albert E., for instance, is represented by the ordered pair (25 hours/week,   3.5 GPA), while his \u201cwhat-me-worry?\u201d classmate Alfred E. is represented by the  ordered pair (5 hours/week, 2.0 GPA).We can graph these ordered pairs on a two-dimensional grid.The first number  in each ordered pair, called the x-coordinate, tells us the horizontal location of the  point.The second number, called the y-coordinate, tells us the vertical location of  the point.The point with both an x-coordinate and a y-coordinate of zero is known  as the origin.The two coordinates in the ordered pair tell us where the point is located  in relation to the origin: x units to the right of the origin and y units above it.Figure 2A-2 graphs grade point average against study time for Albert E.,  Alfred E., and their classmates.This type of graph is called a scatterplot because it  plots scattered points.Looking at this graph, we immediately notice that points  farther to the right (indicating more study time) also tend to be higher (indicating  a better grade point average).Because study time and grade point average typically  move in the same direction, we say that these two variables have a positive   \f PART ONE INTRODUCTION   Figure 2A-2  USING THE COORDINATE SYSTEM.Grade point average is measured  on the vertical axis and study  time on the horizontal axis.Albert E., Alfred E., and their  classmates are represented by  various points.We can see from  the graph that students who  study more tend to get higher  grades.Grade  Point  Average  2.5  2.0  1.5  1.0  0.5  40 Study  Time  (hours

it tells us how many novels Emma purchases at any  given price.The demand curve is downward sloping, indicating that a higher  price reduces the quantity of novels demanded.Because the quantity of novels  demanded and the price move in opposite directions, we say that the two variables  are negatively related.(Conversely, when two variables move in the same direction,  the curve relating them is upward sloping, and we say the variables are  positively related.)Now suppose that Emma\u2019s income rises to $40,000 per year.At any given  price, Emma will purchase more novels than she did at her previous level of income.Just as earlier we drew Emma\u2019s demand curve for novels using the entries  from the middle column of Table 2A-1, we now draw a new demand curve using  the entries from the right-hand column of the table.This new demand curve  (curve D2) is pictured alongside the old one (curve D1) in Figure 2A-4; the new  curve is a similar line drawn farther to the right.We therefore say that Emma\u2019s demand  curve for novels shifts to the right when her income increases.Likewise, if  Emma\u2019s income were to fall to $20,000 per year, she would buy fewer novels at any  given price and her demand curve would shift to the left (to curve D3).In economics, it is important to distinguish between movements along a curve  and shifts of a curve.As we can see from Figure 2A-3, if Emma earns $30,000 per  year and novels cost $8 apiece, she will purchase 13 novels per year.If the price of  novels falls to $7, Emma will increase her purchases of novels to 17 per year.The  demand curve, however, stays fixed in the same place.Emma still buys the same   Figur e 2A-4  SHIFTING DEMAND CURVES.The location of Emma\u2019s demand  curve for novels depends on how  much income she earns.The  more she earns, the more novels  she will purchase at any given  price, and the farther to the right  her demand curve will lie.Curve D1 represents Emma\u2019s  original demand curve when her  income is $30,000 per year.If her  income rises to $40,000 per year,  her demand curve shifts to D2.If  her income falls to $20,000 per  year, her demand curve shifts  to D3.Price of  Novels  5  4  3  2  1  30 Quantity  of Novels  Purchased  6  7  8  9  10  $11  0 5 13 16 10 15 20 25  (13, $8)  (16, $8)  D3  (income =  $20,000)  D1  (income =  $30,000)  D2 (income =  $40,000)  (10, $8)  When income increases,  the demand curve  shifts to the right.When income  decreases, the  demand curve  shifts to the left.CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   number of novels at each price, but as the price falls she moves along her demand  curve from left to right.By contrast, if the price of novels remains fixed at $8 but  her income rises to $40,000, Emma increases her purchases of novels from 13 to 16  per year.Because Emma buys more novels at each price, her demand curve shifts  out, as shown in Figure 2A-4.There is a simple way to tell when it is necessary to shift a curve.When a variable  that is not named on either axis changes, the curve shifts.Income is on neither  the x-axis nor the y-axis of the graph, so when Emma\u2019s income changes, her demand  curve must shift.Any change that affects Emma\u2019s purchasing habits besides  a change in the price of novels will result in a shift in her demand curve.If, for instance,  the public library closes and Emma must buy all the books she wants to  read, she will demand more novels at each price, and her demand curve will shift  to the right.Or, if the price of movies falls and Emma spends more time at the  movies and less time reading, she will demand fewer novels at each price, and her  demand curve will shift to the left.By contrast, when a variable on an axis of the  graph changes, the curve does not shift.We read the change as a movement along  the curve.SLOPE   One question we might want to ask about Emma is how much her purchasing  habits respond to price.Look at the demand curve pictured in Figure 2A-5.If this  curve is very steep, Emma purchases nearly the same number of novels regardless   Price of  Novels  5  4  3  2  1  30 Quantity  of Novels  Purchased  6  7  8  9  10  $11  0 5 21 13 10 15 20 25  Demand, D1  (13, $8)  (21, $6)  6 8 2  21 13 8  Figure 2A-5  CALCULATING THE SLOPE OF A  LINE.To calculate the slope of  the demand curve, we can look  at the changes in the x- and  y-coordinates as we move from  the point (21 novels, $6) to the  point (13 novels, $8).The slope of  the line is the ratio of the change  in the y-coordinate ( 2) to the  change in the x-coordinate ( 8),  which equals 1/4.PART ONE   INTRODUCTION   of whether they are cheap or expensive.If this curve is much flatter, Emma purchases  many fewer novels when the price rises.To answer questions about how  much one variable responds to changes in another variable, we can use the concept  of slope.The slope of a line is the ratio of the vertical distance covered to the horizontal   distance covered as we move along the line.This definition is usually written out   in mathematical symbols as follows:   y   slope = ,   x   where the Greek letter .(delta) stands for the change in a variable.In other words,  the slope of a line is equal to the \u201crise\u201d (change in y) divided by the \u201crun\u201d (change  in x).The slope will be a small positive number for a fairly flat upward-sloping line,  a large positive number for a steep upward-sloping line, and a negative number  for a downward-sloping line.A horizontal line has a slope of zero because in  this case the y-variable never changes; a vertical line is defined to have an infinite  slope because the y-variable can take any value without the x-variable changing  at all.What is the slope of Emma\u2019s demand curve for novels?First of all, because the  curve slopes down, we know the slope will be negative.To calculate a numerical  value for the slope, we must choose two points on the line.With Emma\u2019s income  at $30,000, she will purchase 21 novels at a price of $6 or 13 novels at a price of $8.When we apply the slope formula, we are concerned with the change between  these two points; in other words, we are concerned with the difference between  them, which lets us know that we will have to subtract one set of values from the  other, as follows:   y first y-coordinate second y-coordinate 6 8 2 1   slope = = = = = .x first x-coordinate second x-coordinate 21 13 8 4   Figure 2A-5 shows graphically how this calculation works.Try computing the  slope of Emma\u2019s demand curve using two different points.You should get exactly  the same result, 1/4.One of the properties of a straight line is that it has the same  slope everywhere.This is not true of other types of curves, which are steeper in  some places than in others.The slope of Emma\u2019s demand curve tells us something about how responsive  her purchases are to changes in the price.A small slope (a number close to zero)  means that Emma\u2019s demand curve is relatively flat; in this case, she adjusts the  number of novels she buys substantially in response to a price change.A larger  slope (a number farther from zero) means that Emma\u2019s demand curve is relatively  steep; in this case, she adjusts the number of novels she buys only slightly in response  to a price change.CAUSE AND EFFECT   Economists often use graphs to advance an argument about how the economy  works.In other words, they use graphs to argue about how one set of events  causes another set of events.With a graph like the demand curve, there is no  doubt about cause and effect.Because we are varying price and holding all other   \f CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   variables constant, we know that changes in the price of novels cause changes in  the quantity Emma demands.Remember, however, that our demand curve came  from a hypothetical example.When graphing data from the real world, it is often  more difficult to establish how one variable affects another.The first problem is that it is difficult to hold everything else constant when  measuring how one variable affects another.If we are not able to hold variables  constant, we might decide that one variable on our graph is causing changes in the  other variable when actually those changes are caused by a third omitted variable  not pictured on the graph.Even if we have identified the correct two variables to  look at, we might run into a second problem\u2014reverse causality.In other words, we  might decide that A causes B when in fact B causes A.The omitted-variable and  reverse-causality traps require us to proceed with caution when using graphs to  draw conclusions about causes and effects.Omitted Variables To see how omitting a variable can lead to a deceptive  graph, let\u2019s consider an example.Imagine that the government, spurred by  public concern about the large number of deaths from cancer, commissions an exhaustive  study from Big Brother Statistical Services, Inc. Big Brother examines  many of the items found in people\u2019s homes to see which of them are associated  with the risk of cancer.Big Brother reports a strong relationship between two variables:  the number of cigarette lighters that a household owns and the probability  that someone in the household will develop cancer.Figure 2A-6 shows this  relationship.What should we make of this result?Big Brother advises a quick policy response.It recommends that the government discourage the ownership of cigarette  lighters by taxing their sale.It also recommends that the government require  warning labels: \u201cBig Brother has determined that this lighter is dangerous to your  health.\u201d   In judging the validity of Big Brother\u2019s analysis, one question is paramount:  Has Big Brother held constant every relevant variable except the one under consideration?If the answer is no, the results are suspect.An easy explanation for Figure  2A-6 is that people who own more cigarette lighters are more likely to smoke  cigarettes and that cigarettes, not lighters, cause cancer.If Figure 2A-6 does not   Risk of  Cancer  Number of Lighters in House 0  Figure 2A-6  GRAPH WITH AN OMITTED  VARIABLE.The upward-sloping  curve shows that members of  households with more cigarette  lighters are more likely to  develop cancer.Yet we should  not conclude that ownership of  lighters causes cancer because the  graph does not take into account  the number of cigarettes smoked.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   hold constant the amount of smoking, it does not tell us the true effect of owning  a cigarette lighter.This story illustrates an important principle: When you see a graph being used  to support an argument about cause and effect, it is important to ask whether the  movements of an omitted variable could explain the results you see.Reverse Causality Economists can also make mistakes about causality  by misreading its direction.To see how this is possible, suppose the Association  of American Anarchists commissions a study of crime in America and arrives  at Figure 2A-7, which plots the number of violent crimes per thousand people  in major cities against the number of police officers per thousand people.The anarchists  note the curve\u2019s upward slope and argue that because police increase  rather than decrease the amount of urban violence, law enforcement should be  abolished.If we could run a controlled experiment, we would avoid the danger of reverse  causality.To run an experiment, we would set the number of police officers  in different cities randomly and then examine the correlation between police and  crime.Figure 2A-7, however, is not based on such an experiment.We simply observe  that more dangerous cities have more police officers.The explanation for this  may be that more dangerous cities hire more police.In other words, rather than  police causing crime, crime may cause police.Nothing in the graph itself allows us  to establish the direction of causality.It might seem that an easy way to determine the direction of causality is to  examine which variable moves first.If we see crime increase and then the police  force expand, we reach one conclusion.If we see the police force expand and then  crime increase, we reach the other.Yet there is also a flaw with this approach:  Often people change their behavior not in response to a change in their present  conditions but in response to a change in their expectations of future conditions.A city that expects a major crime wave in the future, for instance, might well hire  more police now.This problem is even easier to see in the case of babies and minivans.Couples often buy a minivan in anticipation of the birth of a child.The   Violent  Crimes  (per 1,000  people)  Police Officers  (per 1,000 people)  0  Figur e 2A-7  GRAPH SUGGESTING REVERSE  CAUSALITY.The upward- sloping curve shows that cities  with a higher concentration of  police are more dangerous.Yet the graph does not tell us  whether police cause crime or  crime-plagued cities hire more  police.CHAPTER 2 THINKING LIKE AN ECONOMIST   minivan comes before the baby, but we wouldn\u2019t want to conclude that the sale  of minivans causes the population to grow!There is no complete set of rules that says when it is appropriate to draw  causal conclusions from graphs.Yet just keeping in mind that cigarette lighters  don\u2019t cause cancer (omitted variable) and minivans don\u2019t cause larger families  (reverse causality) will keep you from falling for many faulty economic  arguments.",

group of institutions in the The financial system consists of those institutions in the economy that help to  economy that help to match one match one person\u2019s saving with another person\u2019s investment.As we discussed in  person\u2019s saving with another the previous chapter, saving and investment are key ingredients to long-run  person\u2019s investment economic growth: When a country saves a large portion of its GDP, more resources  are available for investment in capital, and higher capital raises a country\u2019s  productivity and living standard.The previous chapter, however, did not explain  how the economy coordinates saving and investment.At any time, some people  want to save some of their income for the future, and others want to borrow in order  to finance investments in new and growing businesses.What brings these  two groups of people together?What ensures that the supply of funds from  those who want to save balances the demand for funds from those who want to  invest?This chapter examines how the financial system works.First, we discuss the  large variety of institutions that make up the financial system in our economy.Second,  we discuss the relationship between the financial system and some key  macroeconomic variables\u2014notably saving and investment.Third, we develop a  model of the supply and demand for funds in financial markets.In the model, the  interest rate is the price that adjusts to balance supply and demand.The model  shows how various government policies affect the interest rate and, thereby, society\u2019s  allocation of scarce resources.FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE U.S. ECONOMY  At the broadest level, the financial system moves the economy\u2019s scarce resources  from savers (people who spend less than they earn) to borrowers (people who  spend more than they earn).Savers save for various reasons\u2014to put a child  through college in several years or to retire comfortably in several decades.Similarly,  borrowers borrow for various reasons\u2014to buy a house in which to live or to  start a business with which to make a living.Savers supply their money to the financial  system with the expectation that they will get it back with interest at a later  date.Borrowers demand money from the financial system with the knowledge  that they will be required to pay it back with interest at a later date.The financial system is made up of various financial institutions that help coordinate  savers and borrowers.As a prelude to analyzing the economic forces that  drive the financial system, let\u2019s discuss the most important of these institutions.Financial  institutions can be grouped into two categories\u2014financial markets and financial  intermediaries.We consider each category in turn.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 267   FINANCIAL MARKETS   Financial markets are the institutions through which a person who wants to save  can directly supply funds to a person who wants to borrow.The two most important  financial markets in our economy are the bond market and the stock market.The Bond Market When Intel, the giant maker of computer chips, wants to  borrow to finance construction of a new factory, it can borrow directly from the  public.It does this by selling bonds.A bond is a certificate of indebtedness that  specifies the obligations of the borrower to the holder of the bond.Put simply, a  bond is an IOU.It identifies the time at which the loan will be repaid, called the  date of maturity, and the rate of interest that will be paid periodically until the loan  matures.The buyer of a bond gives his or her money to Intel in exchange for this  promise of interest and eventual repayment of the amount borrowed (called the  principal).The buyer can hold the bond until maturity or can sell the bond at an  earlier date to someone else.There are literally millions of different bonds in the U.S. economy.When large  corporations, the federal government, or state and local governments need to borrow  to finance the purchase of a new factory, a new jet fighter, or a new school,  they usually do so by issuing bonds.If you look at The Wall Street Journal or the  business section of your local newspaper, you will find a listing of the prices and  interest rates on some of the most important bond issues.Although these bonds  differ in many ways, three characteristics of bonds are most important.The first characteristic is a bond\u2019s term\u2014the length of time until the bond matures.Some bonds have short terms, such as a few months, while others have  terms as long as 30 years.(The British government has even issued a bond that  never matures, called a perpetuity.This bond pays interest forever, but the principal  is never repaid.)The interest rate on a bond depends, in part, on its term.Longterm  bonds are riskier than short-term bonds because holders of long-term bonds  have to wait longer for repayment of principal.If a holder of a long-term bond  needs his money earlier than the distant date of maturity, he has no choice but to  sell the bond to someone else, perhaps at a reduced price.To compensate for this  risk, long-term bonds usually pay higher interest rates than short-term bonds.The second important characteristic of a bond is its credit risk\u2014the probability  that the borrower will fail to pay some of the interest or principal.Such a failure to  pay is called a default.Borrowers can (and sometimes do) default on their loans by  declaring bankruptcy.When bond buyers perceive that the probability of default  is high, they demand a higher interest rate to compensate them for this risk.Because  the U.S. government is considered a safe credit risk, government bonds tend  to pay low interest rates.By contrast, financially shaky corporations raise money  by issuing junk bonds, which pay very high interest rates.Buyers of bonds can  judge credit risk by checking with various private agencies, such as Standard &  Poor\u2019s, which rate the credit risk of different bonds.The third important characteristic of a bond is its tax treatment\u2014the way in  which the tax laws treat the interest earned on the bond.The interest on most  bonds is taxable income, so that the bond owner has to pay a portion of the interest  in income taxes.By contrast, when state and local governments issue bonds,  called municipal bonds, the bond owners are not required to pay federal income tax  on the interest income.Because of this tax advantage, bonds issued by state and   financial markets   financial institutions through  which savers can directly  provide funds to borrowers   bond   a certificate of indebtedness   \f 268 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   stock   a claim to partial ownership in a firm    THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE   financial intermediaries   financial institutions through which  savers can indirectly provide funds  to borrowers   local governments pay a lower interest rate than bonds issued by corporations or  the federal government.The Stock Market Another way for Intel to raise funds to build a new  semiconductor factory is to sell stock in the company.Stock represents ownership  in a firm and is, therefore, a claim to the profits that the firm makes.For example,  if Intel sells a total of 1,000,000 shares of stock, then each share represents ownership  of 1/1,000,000 of the business.The sale of stock to raise money is called equity finance, whereas the sale of  bonds is called debt finance.Although corporations use both equity and debt finance  to raise money for new investments, stocks and bonds are very different.The owner of shares of Intel stock is a part owner of Intel; the owner of an Intel  bond is a creditor of the corporation.If Intel is very profitable, the stockholders enjoy  the benefits of these profits, whereas the bondholders get only the interest on  their bonds.And if Intel runs into financial difficulty, the bondholders are paid  what they are due before stockholders receive anything at all.Compared to bonds,  stocks offer the holder both higher risk and potentially higher return.After a corporation issues stock by selling shares to the public, these shares  trade among stockholders on organized stock exchanges.In these transactions, the  corporation itself receives no money when its stock changes hands.The most important  stock exchanges in the U.S. economy are the New York Stock Exchange,  the American Stock Exchange, and NASDAQ (National Association of Securities  Dealers Automated Quotation system).Most of the world\u2019s countries have their  own stock exchanges on which the shares of local companies trade.The prices at which shares trade on stock exchanges are determined by the  supply and demand for the stock in these companies.Because stock represents  ownership in a corporation, the demand for a stock (and thus its price) reflects  people\u2019s perception of the corporation\u2019s future profitability.When people become  optimistic about a company\u2019s future, they raise their demand for its stock and  thereby bid up the price of a share of stock.Conversely, when people come to expect  a company to have little profit or even losses, the price of a share falls.Various stock indexes are available to monitor the overall level of stock prices.A stock index is computed as an average of a group of stock prices.The most famous  stock index is the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has been computed  regularly since 1896.It is now based on the prices of the stocks of 30 major U.S.  companies, such as General Motors, General Electric, Microsoft, Coca-Cola, AT&T,  and IBM.Another well-known stock index is the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index,  which is based on the prices of 500 major companies.Because stock prices reflect  expected profitability, these stock indexes are watched closely as possible indicators  of future economic conditions.FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES   Financial intermediaries are financial institutions through which savers can indirectly  provide funds to borrowers.The term intermediary reflects the role of these  institutions in standing between savers and borrowers.Here we consider two of  the most important financial intermediaries\u2014banks and mutual funds.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 269   Most daily newspapers include  stock tables, which contain in- formation about recent trading  in the stocks of several thou- sand companies.Here is the  kind of information these ta- bles usually provide:  \u0001Price.The single most im- portant piece of informa- tion about a stock is the  price of a share.The  newspaper usually pre- sents several prices.The  \u201clast\u201d or \u201cclosing\u201d price is the price of the last trans- action that occurred before the stock exchange closed  the previous day.Many newspapers also give the \u201chigh\u201d  and \u201clow\u201d prices over the past day of trading and,  sometimes, over the past year as well.Most newspapers present the number of  shares sold during the past day of trading.This figure is  called the daily volume.\u0001Dividend.Corporations pay out some of their profits to  their stockholders; this amount is called the dividend.(Profits not paid out are called retained earnings and  are used by the corporation for additional investment.)Newspapers often report the dividend paid over the pre- vious year for each share of stock.They sometimes  report the dividend yield, which is the dividend ex- pressed as a percentage of the stock\u2019s price.\u0001Price-earnings ratio.A corporation\u2019s earnings, or profit,  is the amount of revenue it receives for the sale of its  products minus its costs of production as measured by  its accountants.Earnings per share is the company\u2019s  total earnings divided by the number of shares of stock  outstanding.Companies use some of their earnings to  pay dividends to stockholders; the rest is kept in the  firm to make new investments.The price\u2013earnings  ratio, often called the P/E, is the price of a corpora- tion\u2019s stock divided by the amount the corporation  earned per share over the past year.Historically, the  typical price\u2013earnings ratio is about 15.A higher P/E in- dicates that a corporation\u2019s stock is expensive relative  to its recent earnings; this might indicate either that  people expect earnings to rise in the future or that the  stock is overvalued.Conversely, a lower P/E indicates  that a corporation\u2019s stock is cheap relative to its recent  earnings; this might indicate either that people expect  earnings to fall or that the stock is undervalued.Why does the newspaper report all these data every day?Many people who invest their savings in stock follow these  numbers closely when deciding which stocks to buy and sell.By contrast, other stockholders follow a buy-and-hold strat- egy: They buy the stock of well-run companies, hold it for  long periods of time, and do not respond to the daily fluctu- ations reported in the paper.Name of  company  Symbol for  company\u2019s stock  52 Weeks  Hi Lo Stock Sym Div  Yld  %PE  Vol  100s Hi Lo Close  Net  Chg  263/16  127/8  757/16  221/2  237/16  67/8  475/16  93/4  CslFnl

Tables  Banks   If the owner of a small grocery store wants to finance an expansion of his business,  he probably takes a strategy quite different from Intel.Unlike Intel, a small grocer   \f 270 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   would find it difficult to raise funds in the bond and stock markets.Most buyers of  stocks and bonds prefer to buy those issued by larger, more familiar companies.The small grocer, therefore, most likely finances his business expansion with a loan  from a local bank.Banks are the financial intermediaries with which people are most familiar.A  primary job of banks is to take in deposits from people who want to save and use  these deposits to make loans to people who want to borrow.Banks pay depositors  interest on their deposits and charge borrowers slightly higher interest on their  loans.The difference between these rates of interest covers the banks\u2019 costs and returns  some profit to the owners of the banks.Besides being financial intermediaries, banks play a second important role in  the economy: They facilitate purchases of goods and services by allowing people  to write checks against their deposits.In other words, banks help create a special  asset that people can use as a medium of exchange.A medium of exchange is an item  that people can easily use to engage in transactions.A bank\u2019s role in providing a  medium of exchange distinguishes it from many other financial institutions.Stocks and bonds, like bank deposits, are a possible store of value for the wealth that  people have accumulated in past saving, but access to this wealth is not as easy,  cheap, and immediate as just writing a check.For now, we ignore this second  role of banks, but we will return to it when we discuss the monetary system in  Chapter 15.Mutual Funds A financial intermediary of increasing importance in the U.S.   mutual fund economy is the mutual fund.A mutual fund is an institution that sells shares to   an institution that sells shares the public and uses the proceeds to buy a selection, or portfolio, of various types of   to the public and uses the proceeds stocks, bonds, or both stocks and bonds.The shareholder of the mutual fund ac-  to buy a portfolio of stocks and bonds cepts all the risk and return associated with the portfolio.If the value of the portfolio  rises, the shareholder benefits; if the value of the portfolio falls, the  shareholder suffers the loss.The primary advantage of mutual funds is that they allow people with small  amounts of money to diversify.Buyers of stocks and bonds are well advised to  heed the adage: Don\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.Because the value of any  single stock or bond is tied to the fortunes of one company, holding a single kind  of stock or bond is very risky.By contrast, people who hold a diverse portfolio of  stocks and bonds face less risk because they have only a small stake in each company.Mutual funds make this diversification easy.With only a few hundred dollars,  a person can buy shares in a mutual fund and, indirectly, become the part  owner or creditor of hundreds of major companies.For this service, the company    \f CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 271   operating the mutual fund charges shareholders a fee, usually between 0.5 and 2.0  percent of assets each year.A second advantage claimed by mutual fund companies is that mutual funds  give ordinary people access to the skills of professional money managers.The  managers of most mutual funds pay close attention to the developments and  prospects of the companies in which they buy stock.These managers buy the stock  of those companies that they view as having a profitable future and sell the stock  of companies with less promising prospects.This professional management, it is  argued, should increase the return that mutual fund depositors earn on their savings.Financial economists, however, are often skeptical of this second argument.With thousands of money managers paying close attention to each company\u2019s  prospects, the price of a company\u2019s stock is usually a good reflection of the company\u2019s  true value.As a result, it is hard to \u201cbeat the market\u201d by buying good stocks  and selling bad ones.In fact, mutual funds called index funds, which buy all the  stocks in a given stock index, perform somewhat better on average than mutual  funds that take advantage of active management by professional money managers.The explanation for the superior performance of index funds is that they  keep costs low by buying and selling very rarely and by not having to pay the  salaries of the professional money managers.SUMMING UP   The U.S. economy contains a large variety of financial institutions.In addition to  the bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual funds, there are also pension  funds, credit unions, insurance companies, and even the local loan shark.These institutions differ in many ways.When analyzing the macroeconomic role  of the financial system, however, it is more important to keep in mind the similarity  of these institutions than the differences.These financial institutions all serve  the same goal\u2014directing the resources of savers into the hands of borrowers.QUICK QUIZ: What is stock?What is a bond?How are they different?How are they similar?SAVING AND INVESTMENT  IN THE NATIONAL INCOME ACCOUNTS  Events that occur within the financial system are central to understanding developments  in the overall economy.As we have just seen, the institutions that make  up this system\u2014the bond market, the stock market, banks, and mutual funds\u2014  have the role of coordinating the economy\u2019s saving and investment.And as we  saw in the previous chapter, saving and investment are important determinants of  long-run growth in GDP and living standards.As a result, macroeconomists need  to understand how financial markets work and how various events and policies  affect them.272 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   IN THE NEWS  The Stock Market Boom  of the 1990s  THE U.S. STOCK MARKET EXPERIENCED A  quadrupling of stock prices during the  1990s.The following article tries to explain  this remarkable boom.It suggests  that people bid up stock prices because  they came to view stocks as less risky  than they previously thought.Are Stocks Overvalued?Not a Chance   BY JAMES K. GLASSMAN  AND KEVIN A. HASSETT  The Dow Jones Industrial Average has  returned more than 200 percent over   the past five years, and the past three  have set an all-time record.So it\u2019s  hardly surprising that many observers  worry the stock market is overvalued.One of the most popular measures of  valuation, the ratio of a stock\u2019s price to  its earnings per share, P/E, is close to  an all-time high.The P/E of the average  stock on the Dow is 22.5, meaning that  it costs $22.50 to buy $1 in profits\u2014or,  conversely, that an investor\u2019s return  (earnings divided by price) is just 4.4  percent, vs. 5.9 percent for long-term  Treasury bonds.Yet Warren Buffett, chairman of  Berkshire Hathaway Corp. and the  most successful large-scale investor of  our time, told shareholders in a March  14 letter that \u201cthere is no reason to  think of stocks as generally overvalued\u201d  as long as interest rates remain  low and businesses continue to operate  as profitably as they have in recent  years.Investors were buoyed by this  statement, even though Mr. Buffett  provided no analysis to back up his assertion.Mr. Buffett is right\u2014and we have  the numbers and the theory to back him  up.Worries about overvaluation, we believe,  are based on a serious and widespread  misunderstanding of the returns  and risks associated with equities.We  are not so foolish as to predict the short- term course of stocks, but we are not reluctant  to state that, based on modest  assumptions about interest rates and  profit levels, current P/E levels give us  no great concern\u2014nor would levels as  much as twice as high.The fact is that if you hold stocks instead  of bonds the amount of money  flowing into your pockets will be higher  over time.Both bonds and stocks  provide their owners with a flow of cash  over time.For bonds, the arithmetic is  simple: If you buy a $10,000 bond paying  6 percent interest today, you\u2019ll receive  $600 every year.For equities, the math  is more complicated: Assume that a  stock currently yields 2 percent, or $2  for each share priced at $100.Say you  own 100 shares; total dividend payments  are $200\u2014much lower than for bonds.As a starting point for an analysis of financial markets, we discuss in this section  the key macroeconomic variables that measure activity in these markets.Our  emphasis here is not on behavior but on accounting.Accounting refers to how various  numbers are defined and added up.A personal accountant might help an individual  add up his income and expenses.A national income accountant does the  same thing for the economy as a whole.The national income accounts include, in  particular, GDP and the many related statistics.The rules of national income accounting include several important identities.Recall that an identity is an equation that must be true because of the way the variables  in the equation are defined.Identities are useful to keep in mind, for they  clarify how different variables are related to one another.Here we consider some  accounting identities that shed light on the macroeconomic role of financial  markets.SOME IMPORTANT IDENTITIES   Recall that gross domestic product (GDP) is both total income in an economy  and the total expenditure on the economy\u2019s output of goods and services.GDP   \f CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 273   But wait.There is a big difference.Profits grow over time.If that dividend  should increase with profits, say at a  rate of 5 percent annually, then, by the  30th year, your annual dividend payment  will be over $800, or one-third more than  the bond is yielding.The price of the  stock almost certainly will have risen  as well.By this simple exercise, we can see  that stocks\u2014even with their profits  growing at a moderate 5 percent\u2014will  return far more than bonds over long periods.Over the past 70 years, stocks  have annually returned 4.8 percentage  points more than long-term U.S.  Treasury bonds and 6.8 points more  than Treasury bills, according to Ibbot- son Associates Inc., a Chicago research  firm.But isn\u2019t that extra reward\u2014what  economists call the \u201cequity premium\u201d\u2014  merely the bonus paid by the market to  investors who accept higher risk, since  returns for stocks are so much more uncertain  than for bonds?To this question,  we respond: What extra risk?In his book \u201cStocks for the Long  Run,\u201d Jeremy J. Siegel of the University  of Pennsylvania concludes: \u201cIt is widely  known that stock returns, on average,  exceed bonds in the long run.But it is little  known that in the long run, the risks in  stocks are less than those found in  bonds or even bills!\u201d Mr. Siegel looked  at every 20-year holding period from  1802 to 1992 and found that the worst  real return for stocks was an annual average  of 1.2 percent and the best was  an annual average of 12.6 percent.For  long-term bonds, the range was minus   3.1 percent to plus 8.8 percent; for T- bills, minus 3.0 percent to plus 8.3 percent.Based on these findings, it would  seem that there should be no need for  an equity risk premium at all\u2014and that  the correct valuation for the stock market  would be one that equalizes the  present value of cash flow between  stocks and bonds in the long run.Think  of the market as offering you two assets,  one that will pay you $1,000 over the  next 30 years in a steady stream and   another that, just as surely, will pay you  the $1,000, but the cash flow will vary  from year to year.Assuming you\u2019re investing  for the long term, you will value  them about the same.Allow us now to suggest a hypothesis  about the huge returns posted by the  stock market over the past few years:  As mutual funds have advertised the reduction  of risk acquired by taking the  long view, the risk premium required by  shareholders has gradually drifted down.Since Siegel\u2019s results suggest that the  correct risk premium might be zero, this  drift downward\u2014and the corresponding  trend toward higher stock prices\u2014may  not be over.In the current environment,  we are very comfortable both in  holding stocks and in saying that pundits  who claim the market is overvalued are  foolish.Source: The Wall Street Journal, Monday, March 30,  1998, p. A18.(denoted as Y) is divided into four components of expenditure: consumption (C),  investment (I), government purchases (G), and net exports (NX).We write   Y C I G NX.This equation is an identity because every dollar of expenditure that shows up on  the left-hand side also shows up in one of the four components on the right-hand  side.Because of the way each of the variables is defined and measured, this equation  must always hold.In this chapter, we simplify our analysis by assuming that the economy we are  examining is closed.A closed economy is one that does not interact with other  economies.In particular, a closed economy does not engage in international trade  in goods and services, nor does it engage in international borrowing and lending.Of course, actual economies are open economies\u2014that is, they interact with other  economies around the world.(We will examine the macroeconomics of open  economies later in this book.)Nonetheless, assuming a closed economy is a useful  simplification by which we can learn some lessons that apply to all economies.Moreover, this assumption applies perfectly to the world economy (inasmuch as  interplanetary trade is not yet common).274 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   national saving (saving)   the total income in the  economy that remains after  paying for consumption and  government purchases   private saving   the income that households  have left after paying for taxes  and consumption   public saving   the tax revenue that the government  has left after paying for its spending   budget surplus   an excess of tax revenue over  government spending   budget deficit   a shortfall of tax revenue from  government spending   Because a closed economy does not engage in international trade, imports and  exports are exactly zero.Therefore, net exports (NX) are also zero.In this case, we  can write   Y C I G.   This equation states that GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, and government  purchases.Each unit of output sold in a closed economy is consumed, invested,  or bought by the government.To see what this identity can tell us about financial markets, subtract C and G  from both sides of this equation.We obtain   Y C G I.The left-hand side of this equation (YCG) is the total income in the economy  that remains after paying for consumption and government purchases: This  amount is called national saving, or just saving, and is denoted S. Substituting  S for Y C G, we can write the last equation as   S I.This equation states that saving equals investment.To understand the meaning of national saving, it is helpful to manipulate the  definition a bit more.Let T denote the amount that the government collects from  households in taxes minus the amount it pays back to households in the form of  transfer payments (such as Social Security and welfare).We can then write national  saving in either of two ways:   SYCG   or   S (YTC) (TG).These equations are the same, because the two T\u2019s in the second equation cancel  each other, but each reveals a different way of thinking about national saving.In  particular, the second equation separates national saving into two pieces: private  saving (YTC) and public saving (TG).Consider each of these two pieces.Private saving is the amount of income that  households have left after paying their taxes and paying for their consumption.In  particular, because households receive income of Y, pay taxes of T, and spend C on  consumption, private saving is Y T C. Public saving is the amount of tax revenue  that the government has left after paying for its spending.The government receives  T in tax revenue and spends G on goods and services.If T exceeds G, the  government runs a budget surplus because it receives more money than it spends.This surplus of TG represents public saving.If the government spends more  than it receives in tax revenue, then G is larger than T. In this case, the government  runs a budget deficit, and public saving TG is a negative number.Now consider how these accounting identities are related to financial markets.The equation SI reveals an important fact: For the economy as a whole, saving must   \f CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 275   be equal to investment.Yet this fact raises some important questions: What mechanisms  lie behind this identity?What coordinates those people who are deciding  how much to save and those people who are deciding how much to invest?The  answer is: the financial system.The bond market, the stock market, banks, mutual  funds, and other financial markets and intermediaries stand between the two sides  of the SI equation.They take in the nation\u2019s saving and direct it to the nation\u2019s  investment.THE MEANING OF SAVING AND INVESTMENT   The terms saving and investment can sometimes be confusing.Most people use  these terms casually and sometimes interchangeably.By contrast, the macroeconomists  who put together the national income accounts use these terms carefully  and distinctly.Consider an example.Suppose that Larry earns more than he spends and deposits  his unspent income in a bank or uses it to buy a bond or some stock from a  corporation.Because Larry\u2019s income exceeds his consumption, he adds to the nation\u2019s  saving.Larry might think of himself as \u201cinvesting\u201d his money, but a macro- economist would call Larry\u2019s act saving rather than investment.In the language of macroeconomics, investment refers to the purchase of new  capital, such as equipment or buildings.When Moe borrows from the bank to  build himself a new house, he adds to the nation\u2019s investment.Similarly, when the    USING SOME OF YOUR INCOME TO BUY

funds and  those who want to borrow to  invest demand funds   Curly Corporation sells some stock and uses the proceeds to build a new factory,  it also adds to the nation\u2019s investment.Although the accounting identity SI shows that saving and investment are  equal for the economy as a whole, this does not have to be true for every individual  household or firm.Larry\u2019s saving can be greater than his investment, and he  can deposit the excess in a bank.Moe\u2019s saving can be less than his investment, and  he can borrow the shortfall from a bank.Banks and other financial institutions  make these individual differences between saving and investment possible by allowing  one person\u2019s saving to finance another person\u2019s investment.QUICK QUIZ: Define private saving, public saving, national saving, and   investment.How are they related?THE MARKET FOR LOANABLE FUNDS  Having discussed some of the important financial institutions in our economy and  the macroeconomic role of these institutions, we are ready to build a model of financial  markets.Our purpose in building this model is to explain how financial  markets coordinate the economy\u2019s saving and investment.The model also gives us  a tool with which we can analyze various government policies that influence saving  and investment.To keep things simple, we assume that the economy has only one financial  market, called the market for loanable funds.All savers go to this market to deposit  their saving, and all borrowers go to this market to get their loans.Thus, the  term loanable funds refers to all income that people have chosen to save and lend  out, rather than use for their own consumption.In the market for loanable funds,  there is one interest rate, which is both the return to saving and the cost of borrowing.The assumption of a single financial market, of course, is not literally true.As  we have seen, the economy has many types of financial institutions.But, as we discussed  in Chapter 2, the art in building an economic model is simplifying the  world in order to explain it.For our purposes here, we can ignore the diversity of  financial institutions and assume that the economy has a single financial market.SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR LOANABLE FUNDS   The economy\u2019s market for loanable funds, like other markets in the economy, is  governed by supply and demand.To understand how the market for loanable  funds operates, therefore, we first look at the sources of supply and demand in  that market.The supply of loanable funds comes from those people who have some extra  income they want to save and lend out.This lending can occur directly, such as  when a household buys a bond from a firm, or it can occur indirectly, such as when  a household makes a deposit in a bank, which in turn uses the funds to make  loans.In both cases, saving is the source of the supply of loanable funds.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 277    \u201cWhoops!There go those darned interest rates again!\u201d   The demand for loanable funds comes from households and firms who wish  to borrow to make investments.This demand includes families taking out mortgages  to buy homes.It also includes firms borrowing to buy new equipment or  build factories.In both cases, investment is the source of the demand for loanable  funds.The interest rate is the price of a loan.It represents the amount that borrowers  pay for loans and the amount that lenders receive on their saving.Because a high  interest rate makes borrowing more expensive, the quantity of loanable funds demanded  falls as the interest rate rises.Similarly, because a high interest rate makes  saving more attractive, the quantity of loanable funds supplied rises as the interest  rate rises.In other words, the demand curve for loanable funds slopes downward,  and the supply curve for loanable funds slopes upward.Figure 13-1 shows the interest rate that balances the supply and demand for  loanable funds.In the equilibrium shown, the interest rate is 5 percent, and the  quantity of loanable funds demanded and the quantity of loanable funds supplied  both equal $1,200 billion.The adjustment of the interest rate to the equilibrium  level occurs for the usual reasons.If the interest rate were lower than the equilibrium  level, the quantity of loanable funds supplied would be less than the quantity  of loanable funds demanded.The resulting shortage of loanable funds would  encourage lenders to raise the interest rate they charge.Conversely, if the interest  rate were higher than the equilibrium level, the quantity of loanable funds supplied  would exceed the quantity of loanable funds demanded.As lenders competed  for the scarce borrowers, interest rates would be driven down.In this way,   \f 278 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   Figure 13-1  THE MARKET FOR LOANABLE  FUNDS.The interest rate in the  economy adjusts to balance the  supply and demand for loanable  funds.The supply of loanable  funds comes from national  saving, including both private  saving and public saving.The demand for loanable  funds comes from firms and  households that want to borrow  for purposes of investment.Here the equilibrium interest  rate is 5 percent, and $1,200  billion of loanable funds are  supplied and demanded.Loanable Funds  (in billions of dollars)  0  Interest  Rate  5%  Supply  Demand  $1,200  the interest rate approaches the equilibrium level at which the supply and demand  for loanable funds exactly balance.Recall that economists distinguish between the real interest rate and the nominal  interest rate.The nominal interest rate is the interest rate as usually reported\u2014  the monetary return to saving and cost of borrowing.The real interest rate is the  nominal interest rate corrected for inflation; it equals the nominal interest rate minus  the inflation rate.Because inflation erodes the value of money over time, the  real interest rate more accurately reflects the real return to saving and cost of borrowing.Therefore, the supply and demand for loanable funds depend on the real  (rather than nominal) interest rate, and the equilibrium in Figure 13-1 should be interpreted  as determining the real interest rate in the economy.For the rest of this  chapter, when you see the term interest rate, you should remember that we are talking  about the real interest rate.This model of the supply and demand for loanable funds shows that financial  markets work much like other markets in the economy.In the market for milk, for  instance, the price of milk adjusts so that the quantity of milk supplied balances  the quantity of milk demanded.In this way, the invisible hand coordinates the behavior  of dairy farmers and the behavior of milk drinkers.Once we realize that  saving represents the supply of loanable funds and investment represents the demand,  we can see how the invisible hand coordinates saving and investment.When the interest rate adjusts to balance supply and demand in the market for  loanable funds, it coordinates the behavior of people who want to save (the suppliers  of loanable funds) and the behavior of people who want to invest (the demanders  of loanable funds).We can now use this analysis of the market for loanable funds to examine various  government policies that affect the economy\u2019s saving and investment.Because  this model is just supply and demand in a particular market, we analyze any  policy using the three steps discussed in Chapter 4.First, we decide whether the  policy shifts the supply curve or the demand curve.Second, we determine the direction  of the shift.Third, we use the supply-and-demand diagram to see how the  equilibrium changes.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 279   Imagine that someone offered  to give you $100 today or  $100 in ten years.Which  would you choose?This is an  easy question.Getting $100  today is clearly better, because  you can always deposit the  money in a bank, still have it in  ten years, and earn interest  along the way.The lesson:  Money today is more valuable  than the same amount of  money in the future.Now consider a harder  question: Imagine that someone offered you $100 today or  $200 in ten years.Which would you choose?To answer  this question, you need some way to compare sums of  money from different points in time.Economists do this  with a concept called present value.The present value of  any future sum of money is the amount today that would  be needed, at current interest rates, to produce that fu- ture sum.To learn how to use the concept of present value, let\u2019s  work through a couple of simple problems:  Question: If you put $100 in a bank account today,  how much will it be worth in N years?That is, what will be  the future value of this $100?Answer: Let\u2019s use r to denote the interest rate ex- pressed in decimal form (so an interest rate of 5 percent  means r 0.05).If interest is paid each year, and if the in- terest paid remains in the bank account to earn more in- terest (a process called compounding), the $100 will  become (1 r) $100 after one year, (1 r) (1 r)  $100 after two years, (1 r) (1 r) (1 r) $100  after three years, and so on.After N years, the $100 be- comes (1 r)N $100.For example, if we are investing at  an interest rate of 5 percent for ten years, then the future  value of the $100 will be (1.05)10 $100, which is $163.Question: Now suppose you are going to be paid $200  in N years.What is the present value of this future pay- ment?That is, how much would you have to deposit in a  bank right now to yield $200 in N years?Answer: To answer this question, just turn the previous  answer on its head.In the last question, we computed a fu- ture value from a present value by multiplying by the factor  (1 r)N. To compute a present value from a future value,  we divide by the factor (1 r)N. Thus, the present value of  $200 in N years is $200/(1 r)N. If that amount is de- posited in a bank today, after N years it would become  (1 r)N [$200/(1 r)N], which is $200.For instance, if  the interest rate is 5 percent, the present value of $200 in  ten years is $200/(1.05)10, which is $123.This illustrates the general formula: If r is the interest rate,  then an amount X to be received in N years has present  value of X/(1 r)N .Let\u2019s now return to our earlier question: Should you  choose $100 today or $200 in ten years?We can infer  from our calculation of present value that if the interest  rate is 5 percent, you should prefer the $200 in ten years.The future $200 has a present value of $123, which is  greater than $100.You are, therefore, better off waiting for  the future sum.Notice that the answer to our question depends on the  interest rate.If the interest rate were 8 percent, then the  $200 in ten years would have a present value of $200/  (1.08)10, which is only $93.In this case, you should take  the $100 today.Why should the interest rate matter for  your choice?The answer is that the higher the interest rate,  the more you can earn by depositing your money at the  bank, so the more attractive getting $100 today becomes.The concept of present value is useful in many appli- cations, including the decisions that companies face when  evaluating investment projects.For instance, imagine that  General Motors is thinking about building a new automobile  factory.Suppose that the factory will cost $100 million to- day and will yield the company $200 million in ten years.Should General Motors undertake the project?You can see  that this decision is exactly like the one we have been  studying.To make its decision, the company will compare  the present value of the $200 million return to the $100  million cost.The company\u2019s decision, therefore, will depend on the  interest rate.If the interest rate is 5 percent, then the  present value of the $200 million return from the factory is  $123 million, and the company will choose to pay the $100  million cost.By contrast, if the interest rate is 8 percent,  then the present value of the return is only $93 million, and  the company will decide to forgo the project.Thus, the con- cept of present value helps explain why investment\u2014and  thus the quantity of loanable funds demanded\u2014declines  when the interest rate rises.Here is another application of present value: Suppose  you win a million-dollar lottery, but the prize is going to be  paid out as $20,000 a year for 50 years.How much is the  prize really worth?After performing 50 calculations similar  to those above (one calculation for each payment) and  adding up the results, you would learn that the present  value of this prize at a 7 percent interest rate is only  $276,000.This is one way that state lotteries make  money\u2014by selling tickets in the present, and paying out  prizes in the future.FYI  Present  Value  \f 280 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   POLICY 1: TAXES AND SAVING   American families save a smaller fraction of their incomes than their counterparts  in many other countries, such as Japan and Germany.Although the reasons for  these international differences are unclear, many U.S. policymakers view the low  level of U.S. saving as a major problem.One of the Ten Principles of Economics in  Chapter 1 is that a country\u2019s standard of living depends on its ability to produce  goods and services.And, as we discussed in the preceding chapter, saving is an  important long-run determinant of a nation\u2019s productivity.If the United States  could somehow raise its saving rate to the level that prevails in other countries, the  growth rate of GDP would increase, and over time, U.S. citizens would enjoy a  higher standard of living.Another of the Ten Principles of Economics is that people respond to incentives.Many economists have used this principle to suggest that the low saving rate in  the United States is at least partly attributable to tax laws that discourage saving.The U.S. federal government, as well as many state governments, collects revenue  by taxing income, including interest and dividend income.To see the effects of this  policy, consider a 25-year-old individual who saves $1,000 and buys a 30-year  bond that pays an interest rate of 9 percent.In the absence of taxes, the $1,000  grows to $13,268 when the individual reaches age 55.Yet if that interest is taxed at  a rate of, say, 33 percent, then the after-tax interest rate is only 6 percent.In this  case, the $1,000 grows to only $5,743 after 30 years.The tax on interest income substantially  reduces the future payoff from current saving and, as a result, reduces  the incentive for people to save.In response to this problem, many economists and lawmakers have proposed  changing the tax code to encourage greater saving.In 1995, for instance, when  Congressman Bill Archer of Texas became chairman of the powerful House Ways  and Means Committee, he proposed replacing the current income tax with a  consumption tax.Under a consumption tax, income that is saved would not be  taxed until the saving is later spent; in essence, a consumption tax is like the sales  taxes that many states now use to collect revenue.A more modest proposal is to  expand eligibility for special accounts, such as Individual Retirement Accounts,  that allow people to shelter some of their saving from taxation.Let\u2019s consider the  effect of such a saving incentive on the market for loanable funds, as illustrated in  Figure 13-2.First, which curve would this policy affect?Because the tax change would alter  the incentive for households to save at any given interest rate, it would affect the  quantity of loanable funds supplied at each interest rate.Thus, the supply of loanable  funds would shift.The demand for loanable funds would remain the same,  because the tax change would not directly affect the amount that borrowers want  to borrow at any given interest rate.Second, which way would the supply curve shift?Because saving would be  taxed less heavily than under current law, households would increase their saving  by consuming a smaller fraction of their income.Households would use this additional  saving to increase their deposits in banks or to buy more bonds.The supply  of loanable funds would increase, and the supply curve would shift to the right  from S1 to S2, as shown in Figure 13-2.Finally, we can compare the old and new equilibria.In the figure, the increased   supply of loanable funds reduces the interest rate from 5 percent to 4 percent.The   lower interest rate raises the quantity of loanable funds demanded from $1,200   \f CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL

AN INCREASE IN THE SUPPLYOF  LOANABLE FUNDS.A change  in the tax laws to encourage  Americans to save more would  shift the supply of loanable funds  to the right from S1 to S2.As a  result, the equilibrium interest  rate would fall, and the lower  interest rate would stimulate  investment.Here the equilibrium  interest rate falls from 5 percent  to 4 percent, and the equilibrium  quantity of loanable funds saved  and invested rises from $1,200  billion to $1,600 billion.billion to $1,600 billion.That is, the shift in the supply curve moves the market  equilibrium along the demand curve.With a lower cost of borrowing, households  and firms are motivated to borrow more to finance greater investment.Thus, if a  change in the tax laws encouraged greater saving, the result would be lower interest rates  and greater investment.Although this analysis of the effects of increased saving is widely accepted  among economists, there is less consensus about what kinds of tax changes should  be enacted.Many economists endorse tax reform aimed at increasing saving in order  to stimulate investment and growth.Yet others are skeptical that these tax  changes would have much effect on national saving.These skeptics also doubt the  equity of the proposed reforms.They argue that, in many cases, the benefits of the  tax changes would accrue primarily to the wealthy, who are least in need of tax relief.We examine this debate more fully in the final chapter of this book.POLICY 2: TAXES AND INVESTMENT   Suppose that Congress passed a law giving a tax reduction to any firm building a  new factory.In essence, this is what Congress does when it institutes an investment  tax credit, which it does from time to time.Let\u2019s consider the effect of such a law on  the market for loanable funds, as illustrated in Figure 13-3.First, would the law affect supply or demand?Because the tax credit would  reward firms that borrow and invest in new capital, it would alter investment at  any given interest rate and, thereby, change the demand for loanable funds.By  contrast, because the tax credit would not affect the amount that households save  at any given interest rate, it would not affect the supply of loanable funds.282 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   Figure 13-3  AN INCREASE IN THE DEMAND  FOR LOANABLE FUNDS.If the  passage of an investment tax  credit encouraged U.S. firms  to invest more, the demand for  loanable funds would increase.As a result, the equilibrium  interest rate would rise, and  the higher interest rate would  stimulate saving.Here, when the  demand curve shifts from D1 to  D2, the equilibrium interest rate  rises from 5 percent to 6 percent,  and the equilibrium quantity  of loanable funds saved and  invested rises from $1,200 billion  to $1,400 billion.Loanable Funds  (in billions of dollars)  0  Interest  Rate  5%  6%  $1,200 $1,400  1.An investment  tax credit  increases the  demand for  loanable funds...  2....which  raises the  equilibrium  interest rate...  3....and raises the equilibrium  quantity of loanable funds.Supply  Demand, D1  D2  Second, which way would the demand curve shift?Because firms would have  an incentive to increase investment at any interest rate, the quantity of loanable  funds demanded would be higher at any given interest rate.Thus, the demand  curve for loanable funds would move to the right, as shown by the shift from D1 to  D2 in the figure.Third, consider how the equilibrium would change.In Figure 13-3, the increased  demand for loanable funds raises the interest rate from 5 percent to 6 percent,  and the higher interest rate in turn increases the quantity of loanable funds  supplied from $1,200 billion to $1,400 billion, as households respond by increasing  the amount they save.This change in household behavior is represented here as a  movement along the supply curve.Thus, if a change in the tax laws encouraged  greater investment, the result would be higher interest rates and greater saving.POLICY 3:  GOVERNMENT BUDGET DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES   Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, one of the most pressing policy issues was the  size of the government budget deficit.Recall that a budget deficit is an excess of  government spending over tax revenue.Governments finance budget deficits by  borrowing in the bond market, and the accumulation of past government borrowing  is called the government debt.In the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. federal government  ran large budget deficits, resulting in a rapidly growing government debt.As  a result, much public debate centered on the effects of these deficits both on the allocation  of the economy\u2019s scarce resources and on long-term economic growth.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 283   Figure 13-4  Loanable Funds  (in billions of dollars)  0  Interest  Rate  $800 $1,200  3....and reduces the equilibrium  quantity of loanable funds....which  raises the  equilibrium  interest rate...  Supply, S1  Demand  5%  6% 1.A budget deficit  decreases the  supply of loanable  funds...  We can analyze the effects of a budget deficit by following our three steps in  the market for loanable funds, which is illustrated in Figure 13-4.First, which  curve shifts when the budget deficit rises?Recall that national saving\u2014the source  of the supply of loanable funds\u2014is composed of private saving and public saving.A change in the government budget deficit represents a change in public saving  and, thereby, in the supply of loanable funds.Because the budget deficit does not  influence the amount that households and firms want to borrow to finance investment  at any given interest rate, it does not alter the demand for loanable funds.Second, which way does the supply curve shift?When the government runs a  budget deficit, public saving is negative, and this reduces national saving.In other  words, when the government borrows to finance its budget deficit, it reduces the  supply of loanable funds available to finance investment by households and firms.Thus, a budget deficit shifts the supply curve for loanable funds to the left from  S1 to S2, as shown in Figure 13-4.Third, we can compare the old and new equilibria.In the figure, when the  budget deficit reduces the supply of loanable funds, the interest rate rises from  5 percent to 6 percent.This higher interest rate then alters the behavior of the  households and firms that participate in the loan market.In particular, many  demanders of loanable funds are discouraged by the higher interest rate.Fewer  families buy new homes, and fewer firms choose to build new factories.The fall in  investment because of government borrowing is called crowding out and is represented  in the figure by the movement along the demand curve from a quantity of  $1,200 billion in loanable funds to a quantity of $800 billion.That is, when the government  borrows to finance its budget deficit, it crowds out private borrowers  who are trying to finance investment.THE EFFECT OF A GOVERNMENT  BUDGET DEFICIT.When the  government spends more than  it receives in tax revenue, the  resulting budget deficit lowers  national saving.The supply of  loanable funds decreases, and  the equilibrium interest rate rises.Thus, when the government  borrows to finance its budget  deficit, it crowds out households  and firms who otherwise would  borrow to finance investment.Here, when the supply shifts  from S1 to S2, the equilibrium  interest rate rises from 5 percent  to 6 percent, and the equilibrium  quantity of loanable funds saved  and invested falls from $1,200  billion to $800 billion.crowding out   a decrease in investment that results  from government borrowing   \f 284 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   Thus, the most basic lesson about budget deficits follows directly from their effects  on the supply and demand for loanable funds: When the government reduces  national saving by running a budget deficit, the interest rate rises, and investment falls.Because investment is important for long-run economic growth, government budget  deficits reduce the economy\u2019s growth rate.Government budget surpluses work just the opposite as budget deficits.When  government collects more in tax revenue than it spends, its saves the difference by  retiring some of the outstanding government debt.This budget surplus, or public  saving, contributes to national saving.Thus, a budget surplus increases the supply of  loanable funds, reduces the interest rate, and stimulates investment.Higher investment,  in turn, means greater capital accumulation and more rapid economic growth.CASE STUDY THE DEBATE OVER THE BUDGET SURPLUS   Our analysis shows why, other things being the same, budget surpluses are better  for economic growth than budget deficits.Making economic policy, however,  is not as simple as this observation may make it sound.A good example  occurred in the late 1990s, when the U.S. government found itself with a budget  surplus, and much debate centered on what to do with it.Many policymakers favored leaving the budget surplus alone, rather than  dissipating it with a spending increase or tax cut.They based their conclusion  on the analysis we have just seen: Using the surplus to retire some of the government  debt would stimulate private investment and economic growth.Other policymakers took a different view.Some thought the surplus should  be used to increase government spending on infrastructure and education because,  they argued, the return to these public investments is greater than the  typical return to private investment.Some thought taxes should be cut, arguing  that lower tax rates would distort decisionmaking less and lead to a more efficient  allocation of resources; they also cautioned that without such a tax cut,   \u201cOur debt-reduction  plan is simple, but it  will require a great  deal of money.\u201d    \f CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 285   Congress would be tempted to spend the surplus on \u201cpork barrel\u201d projects of  dubious value.As this book was going to press, the debate over the budget surplus was  still raging.There is room for reasonable people to disagree.The right policy  depends on how valuable you view private investment, how valuable you view  public investment, how distortionary you view taxation, and how reliable you  view the political process.CASE STUDY THE HISTORY OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT   How indebted is the U.S. government?The answer to this question varies substantially  over time.Figure 13-5 shows the debt of the U.S. federal government  expressed as a percentage of U.S. GDP.It shows that the government debt has  fluctuated from zero in 1836 to 107 percent of GDP in 1945.In recent years, government  debt has been about 50 percent of GDP.The behavior of the debt\u2013GDP ratio is one gauge of what\u2019s happening with  the government\u2019s finances.Because GDP is a rough measure of the government\u2019s  tax base, a declining debt\u2013GDP ratio indicates that the government indebtedness  is shrinking relative to its ability to raise tax revenue.This suggests  that the government is, in some sense, living within its means.By contrast, a rising  debt\u2013GDP ratio means that the government indebtedness is increasing relative  to its ability to raise tax revenue.It is often interpreted as meaning that  fiscal policy\u2014government spending and taxes\u2014cannot be sustained forever at  current levels.Throughout history, the primary cause of fluctuations in government  debt is war.When wars occur, government spending on national defense rises   Percent  of GDP  1790 1810 1830 1850 1870 1890 1910 1930 1950 1970 1990  Revolutionary  War  2010  Civil  War World War I  World War II  0  20  40  60  80  100  120  Figure 13-5  THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT.The debt of the U.S. federal  government, expressed here as  a percentage of GDP, has varied  substantially throughout history.It reached its highest level after  the large expenditures of World  War II, but then declined throughout  the 1950s and 1960s.It began  rising again in the early 1980s  when Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax cuts  were not accompanied by similar  cuts in government spending.It then stabilized and even  declined slightly in the late 1990s.Source: U.S. Department of Treasury; U.S.  Department of Commerce; and T.

equipment.Taxes typically rise as  well but by much less than the increase in spending.The result is a budget  deficit and increasing government debt.When the war is over, government  spending declines, and the debt\u2013GDP ratio starts declining as well.There are two reasons to believe that debt financing of war is an appropriate  policy.First, it allows the government to keep tax rates smooth over time.Without debt financing, tax rates would have to rise sharply during wars, and  as we saw in Chapter 8, this would cause a substantial decline in economic  efficiency.Second, debt financing of wars shifts part of the cost of wars to future  generations, who will have to pay off the government debt.This is arguably  a fair distribution of the burden, for future generations get some of the  benefit when one generation fights a war to defend the nation against foreign  aggressors.One large increase in government debt that cannot be explained by war is  the increase that occurred beginning around 1980.When President Ronald Reagan  took office in 1981, he was committed to smaller government and lower  taxes.Yet he found cutting government spending to be more difficult politically  than cutting taxes.The result was the beginning of a period of large budget  deficits that continued not only through Reagan\u2019s time in office but also for  many years thereafter.As a result, government debt rose from 26 percent of  GDP in 1980 to 50 percent of GDP in 1993.As we discussed earlier, government budget deficits reduce national saving,  investment, and long-run economic growth, and this is precisely why the  rise in government debt during the 1980s troubled so many economists.Policymakers  from both political parties accepted this basic argument and viewed  persistent budget deficits as an important policy problem.When Bill Clinton  moved into the Oval Office in 1993, deficit reduction was his first major goal.Similarly, when the Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, deficit reduction  was high on their legislative agenda.Both of these efforts substantially reduced  the size of the government budget deficit, and it eventually turned into a  small surplus.As a result, by the late 1990s, the debt\u2013GDP ratio was declining  once again.QUICK QUIZ: If more Americans adopted a \u201clive for today\u201d approach to  life, how would this affect saving, investment, and the interest rate?CONCLUSION  \u201cNeither a borrower nor a lender be,\u201d Polonius advises his son in Shakespeare\u2019s  Hamlet.If everyone followed this advice, this chapter would have been  unnecessary.Few economists would agree with Polonius.In our economy, people borrow  and lend often, and usually for good reason.You may borrow one day to start your  own business or to buy a home.And people may lend to you in the hope that the  interest you pay will allow them to enjoy a more prosperous retirement.The financial  system has the job of coordinating all this borrowing and lending activity.CHAPTER 13 SAVING, INVESTMENT, AND THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM 287   In many ways, financial markets are like other markets in the economy.The  price of loanable funds\u2014the interest rate\u2014is governed by the forces of supply and  demand, just as other prices in the economy are.And we can analyze shifts in supply  or demand in financial markets as we do in other markets.One of the Ten Principles  of Economics introduced in Chapter 1 is that markets are usually a good way  to organize economic activity.This principle applies to financial markets as well.When financial markets bring the supply and demand for loanable funds into balance,  they help allocate the economy\u2019s scarce resources to their most efficient use.In one way, however, financial markets are special.Financial markets, unlike  most other markets, serve the important role of linking the present and the future.Those who supply loanable funds\u2014savers\u2014do so because they want to convert  some of their current income into future purchasing power.Those who demand  loanable funds\u2014borrowers\u2014do so because they want to invest today in order to  have additional capital in the future to produce goods and services.Thus, well- functioning financial markets are important not only for current generations but  also for future generations who will inherit many of the resulting benefits.Summary  The U.S. financial system is made up of many types of  financial institutions, such as the bond market, the stock  market, banks, and mutual funds.All these institutions  act to direct the resources of households who want to  save some of their income into the hands of households  and firms who want to borrow.National income accounting identities reveal some  important relationships among macroeconomic  variables.In particular, for a closed economy, national  saving must equal investment.Financial institutions are  the mechanism through which the economy matches  one person\u2019s saving with another person\u2019s investment.The interest rate is determined by the supply and  demand for loanable funds.The supply of loanable   funds comes from households who want to save some  of their income and lend it out.The demand for  loanable funds comes from households and firms who  want to borrow for investment.To analyze how any  policy or event affects the interest rate, one must  consider how it affects the supply and demand for  loanable funds.National saving equals private saving plus public  saving.A government budget deficit represents negative  public saving and, therefore, reduces national saving  and the supply of loanable funds available to finance  investment.When a government budget deficit crowds  out investment, it reduces the growth of productivity  and GDP.Key Concepts  financial system, p. 266 mutual fund, p. 270 budget deficit, p. 274  financial markets, p. 267 national saving (saving), p. 274 market for

               "context":"UNEMPLOYMENT  AND ITS NATURAL RATE   Losing a job can be the most distressing economic event in a person\u2019s life.Most  people rely on their labor earnings to maintain their standard of living, and many  people get from their work not only income but also a sense of personal accomplishment.A job loss means a lower living standard in the present, anxiety about  the future, and reduced self-esteem.It is not surprising, therefore, that politicians  campaigning for office often speak about how their proposed policies will help  create jobs.In the preceding two chapters we have seen some of the forces that determine  the level and growth of a country\u2019s standard of living.A country that saves and invests  a high fraction of its income, for instance, enjoys more rapid growth in its  capital stock and its GDP than a similar country that saves and invests less.An  even more obvious determinant of a country\u2019s standard of living is the amount of  unemployment it typically experiences.People who would like to work but cannot   IN THIS CHAPTER  YOU WILL .Learn about the  data used to  measure the amount  of unemployment   Consider how

production of goods and services.Although some degree of unemployment is inevitable in a complex economy with  thousands of firms and millions of workers, the amount of unemployment varies  substantially over time and across countries.When a country keeps its workers as  fully employed as possible, it achieves a higher level of GDP than it would if it left  many of its workers standing idle.This chapter begins our study of unemployment.The problem of unemployment  is usefully divided into two categories\u2014the long-run problem and the short- run problem.The economy\u2019s natural rate of unemployment refers to the amount of  unemployment that the economy normally experiences.Cyclical unemployment  refers to the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment around its natural rate,  and it is closely associated with the short-run ups and downs of economic activity.Cyclical unemployment has its own explanation, which we defer until we study  short-run economic fluctuations later in this book.In this chapter we discuss the  determinants of an economy\u2019s natural rate of unemployment.As we will see, the  designation natural does not imply that this rate of unemployment is desirable.Nor does it imply that it is constant over time or impervious to economic policy.It  merely means that this unemployment does not go away on its own even in the  long run.We begin the chapter by looking at some of the relevant facts that describe unemployment.In particular, we examine three questions: How does the government  measure the economy\u2019s rate of unemployment?What problems arise in  interpreting the unemployment data?How long are the unemployed typically  without work?We then turn to the reasons why economies always experience some unemployment  and the ways in which policymakers can help the unemployed.We discuss  four explanations for the economy\u2019s natural rate of unemployment: job  search, minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages.As we will see, long- run unemployment does not arise from a single problem that has a single solution.Instead, it reflects a variety of related problems.As a result, there is no easy way  for policymakers to reduce the economy\u2019s natural rate of unemployment and, at  the same time, to alleviate the hardships experienced by the unemployed.IDENTIFYING UNEMPLOYMENT  We begin this chapter by examining more precisely what the term unemployment  means.We consider how the government measures unemployment, what problems  arise in interpreting the unemployment data, and how long the typical spell  of unemployment lasts.HOW IS UNEMPLOYMENT MEASURED?Measuring unemployment is the job of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which  is part of the Department of Labor.Every month the BLS produces data on unemployment  and on other aspects of the labor market, such as types of employment,   \f CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 293   length of the average workweek, and the duration of unemployment.These data  come from a regular survey of about 60,000 households, called the Current Population  Survey.Based on the answers to survey questions, the BLS places each adult (aged sixteen  and older) in each surveyed household into one of three categories:     Employed  Unemployed  Not in the labor force   A person is considered employed if he or she spent most of the previous week  working at a paid job.A person is unemployed if he or she is on temporary layoff,  is looking for a job, or is waiting for the start date of a new job.A person who fits  neither of the first two categories, such as a full-time student, homemaker, or retiree,  is not in the labor force.Figure 14-1 shows this breakdown for 1998.Once the BLS has placed all the individuals covered by the survey in a category,  it computes various statistics to summarize the state of the labor market.The  BLS defines the labor force as the sum of the employed and the unemployed: labor force   the total number of workers,  including both the employed   Labor force Number employed number of unemployed   and the unemployed   Adult  population  (205.2 million)  Labor force  (137.7 million)  Employed  (131.5 million)  Not in labor force  (67.5 million)  Unemployed (6.2 million)  Figure 14-1  THE BREAKDOWN OF THE  POPULATION IN 1998.The  Bureau of Labor Statistics  divides the adult population  into three categories: employed,  unemployed, and not in the  labor force.SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics.294 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   unemployment rate   the percentage of the labor force  that is unemployed   labor-force  participation rate   the percentage of the adult  population that is in the labor force   natural rate of  unemployment   the normal rate of unemployment  around which the unemployment  rate fluctuates   The BLS defines the unemployment rate as the percentage of the labor force that  is unemployed:   Number of unemployed   Unemployment rate 100.Labor force   The BLS computes unemployment rates for the entire adult population and for  more narrow groups\u2014blacks, whites, men, women, and so on.The BLS uses the same survey to produce data on labor-force participation.The labor-force participation rate measures the percentage of the total adult population  of the United States that is in the labor force:   Labor force   Labor-force participation rate 100.Adult population   This statistic tells us the fraction of the population that has chosen to participate in  the labor market.The labor-force participation rate, like the unemployment rate, is  computed both for the entire adult population and for more narrow groups.To see how these data are computed, consider the figures for 1998.In that year,   131.5 million people were employed, and 6.2 million people were unemployed.The labor force was  Labor force 131.5 6.2 137.7 million.The unemployment rate was   Unemployment rate (6.2/137.7) 100 4.5 percent.Because the adult population was 205.2 million, the labor-force participation  rate was   Labor-force participation rate (137.7/205.2) 100 67.1 percent.Hence, in 1998, two-thirds of the U.S. adult population were participating in the  labor market, and 4.5 percent of those labor-market participants were without  work.Table 14-1 shows the statistics on unemployment and labor-force participation  for various groups within the U.S. population.Three comparisons are most apparent.First, women have lower rates of labor-force participation than men, but once  in the labor force, women have similar rates of unemployment.Second, blacks  have similar rates of labor-force participation as whites, and they have much  higher rates of unemployment.Third, teenagers have lower rates of labor-force  participation and much higher rates of unemployment than the overall population.More generally, these data show that labor-market experiences vary widely  among groups within the economy.The BLS data on the labor market also allow economists and policymakers to  monitor changes in the economy over time.Figure 14-2 shows the unemployment  rate in the United States since 1960.The figure shows that the economy always has  some unemployment and that the amount changes from year to year.The normal  rate of unemployment around which the unemployment rate fluctuates is called  the natural rate of unemployment, and the deviation

fluctuations, including the year-to-year fluctuations in unemployment  around its natural rate.In the rest of this chapter, however, we ignore the  short-run fluctuations and examine why unemployment is a chronic problem for  market economies.CASE STUDY LABOR-FORCE PARTICIPATION  OF MEN AND WOMEN IN THE U.S. ECONOMY   Women\u2019s role in American society has changed dramatically over the past century.Social commentators have pointed to many causes for this change.In part,  it is attributable to new technologies such as the washing machine, clothes  dryer, refrigerator, freezer, and dishwasher, which have reduced the amount of  time required to complete routine household tasks.In part, it is attributable to  improved birth control, which has reduced the number of children born to the  typical family.And, of course, this change in women\u2019s role is also partly attributable  to changing political and social attitudes.Together these developments  have had a profound impact on society in general and on the economy in  particular.Nowhere is that impact more obvious than in data on labor-force participation.Figure 14-3 shows the labor-force participation rates of men and women in  the United States since 1950.Just after World War II, men and women had very  different roles in society.Only 33 percent of women were working or looking for  work, in contrast to 87 percent of men.Over the past several decades, the difference  between the participation rates of men and women has gradually diminished,  as growing numbers of women have entered the labor force and  some men have left it.Data for 1998 show that 60 percent of women were in the  labor force, in contrast to 75 percent of men.As measured by labor-force participation,  men and women are now playing a more equal role in the economy.The increase in women\u2019s labor-force participation is easy to understand, but  the fall in men\u2019s may seem puzzling.There are several reasons for this decline.MORE WOMEN ARE WORKING  NOW THAN EVER BEFORE.CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 297   First, young men now stay in school longer than their fathers and grandfathers  did.Second, older men now retire earlier and live longer.Third, with more  women employed, more fathers now stay at home to raise their children.Full- time students, retirees, and stay-at-home fathers are all counted as out of the  labor force.DOES THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE MEASURE  WHAT WE WANT IT TO?Measuring the amount of unemployment in the economy might seem straightforward.In fact, it is not.Whereas it is easy to distinguish between a person with a  full-time job and a person who is not working at all, it is much harder to distinguish  between a person who is unemployed and a person who is not in the labor  force.Movements into and out of the labor force are, in fact, very common.More  than one-third of the unemployed are recent entrants into the labor force.These  entrants include young workers looking for their first jobs, such as recent college  graduates.They also include, in greater numbers, older workers who had previously  left the labor force but have now returned to look for work.Moreover, not all  unemployment ends with the job seeker finding a job.Almost half of all spells of  unemployment end when the unemployed person leaves the labor force.Because people move into and out of the labor force so often, statistics on unemployment  are difficult to interpret.On the one hand, some of those who report  being unemployed may not, in fact, be trying hard to find a job.They may be  calling themselves unemployed because they want to qualify for a government   100  80  60  40  20  0  1950 1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 '98  Labor-Force  Participation  Rate (in

individuals who would like to work  but have given up looking for a job   program that financially assists the unemployed or because they are actually  working and being paid \u201cunder the table.\u201d It may be more realistic to view these  individuals as out of the labor force or, in some cases, employed.On the other  hand, some of those who report being out of the labor force may, in fact, want to  work.These individuals may have tried to find a job but have given up after an  unsuccessful search.Such individuals, called discouraged workers, do not show  up in unemployment statistics, even though they are truly workers without jobs.According to most estimates, adding discouraged workers would increase the  measured unemployment rate by about one-half of one percentage point.There is no easy way to fix the unemployment rate as reported by the BLS to  make it a more reliable indicator of conditions in the labor market.In the end, it is  best to view the reported unemployment rate as a useful but imperfect measure of  joblessness.HOW LONG ARE THE UNEMPLOYED WITHOUT WORK?In judging how serious the problem of unemployment is, one question to consider  is whether unemployment is typically a short-term or long-term condition.If unemployment  is short-term, one might conclude that it is not a big problem.Workers  may require a few weeks between jobs to find the openings that best suit their  tastes and skills.Yet if unemployment is long-term, one might conclude that it is a  serious problem.Workers unemployed for many months are more likely to suffer  economic and psychological hardship.Because the duration of unemployment can affect our view about how big a  problem unemployment is, economists have devoted much energy to studying  data on the duration of unemployment spells.In this work, they have uncovered a  result that is important, subtle, and seemingly contradictory: Most spells of unemployment  are short, and most unemployment observed at any given time is long-term.To see how this statement can be true, consider an example.Suppose that you  visited the government\u2019s unemployment office every week for a year to survey the  unemployed.Each week you find that there are four unemployed workers.Three  of these workers are the same individuals for the whole year, while the fourth person  changes every week.Based on this experience, would you say that unemployment  is typically short-term or long-term?Some simple calculations help answer this question.In this example, you meet  a total of 55 unemployed people; 52 of them are unemployed for one week, and  three are unemployed for the full year.This means that 52/55, or 95 percent, of unemployment  spells end in one week.Thus, most spells of unemployment are short.Yet consider the total amount of unemployment.The three people unemployed for  one year (52 weeks) make up a total of 156 weeks of unemployment.Together with  the 52 people unemployed for one week, this makes 208 weeks of unemployment.In this example, 156/208, or 75 percent, of unemployment is attributable to those  individuals who are unemployed for a full year.Thus, most unemployment observed  at any given time is long-term.This subtle conclusion implies that economists and policymakers must be  careful when interpreting data on unemployment and when designing policies to  help the unemployed.Most people who become unemployed will soon find jobs.Yet most of the economy\u2019s unemployment problem is attributable to the relatively  few workers who are jobless for long periods of time.CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 299   WHY ARE THERE ALWAYS SOME PEOPLE UNEMPLOYED?We have discussed how the government measures the amount of unemployment,  the problems that arise in interpreting unemployment statistics, and the findings  of labor economists on the duration of unemployment.You should now have a  good idea about what unemployment is.This discussion, however, has not explained why economies experience unemployment.In most markets in the economy, prices adjust to bring quantity supplied  and quantity demanded into balance.In an ideal labor market, wages would  adjust to balance the quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor demanded.This adjustment of wages would ensure that all workers are always fully  employed.Of course, reality does not resemble this ideal.There are always some workers  without jobs, even when the overall economy is doing well.In other words, the  unemployment rate never falls to zero; instead, it fluctuates around the natural  rate of unemployment.To understand this natural rate, we now examine the reasons  why actual labor markets depart from the ideal of full employment.To preview our conclusions, we will find that there are four ways to explain  unemployment in the long run.The first explanation is that it takes time for workers  to search for the jobs that are best suited for them.The unemployment that results  from the process of matching workers and jobs is sometimes called frictional frictional unemployment  unemployment, and it is often thought to explain relatively short spells of unem-unemployment that results because  ployment.it takes time for workers to search   The next three explanations for unemployment suggest that the number of for the jobs that best suit their  jobs available in some labor markets may be insufficient to give a job to everyone tastes and skills  who wants one.This occurs when the quantity of labor supplied exceeds the quantity  demanded.Unemployment of this sort is sometimes called structural unem-structural unemployment  ployment, and it is often thought to explain longer spells of unemployment.As we unemployment that results because  will see, this kind of unemployment results when wages are, for some reason, set the number of jobs available in  above the level that brings supply and demand into equilibrium.We will examine some labor markets is insufficient  three possible reasons for an above-equilibrium wage: minimum-wage laws, to provide a job for everyone  unions, and efficiency wages.who wants one   QUICK QUIZ: How is the unemployment rate measured?How might  the unemployment rate overstate the amount of joblessness?How might it  understate it?JOB SEARCH  One reason why economies always experience some unemployment is job search.Job search is the process of matching workers with appropriate jobs.If all workers job search  and all jobs were the same, so that all workers were equally well suited for all jobs, the process by which workers  job search would not be a problem.Laid-off workers would quickly find new find appropriate jobs given  jobs that were well suited for them.But, in fact, workers differ in their tastes and their tastes and skills  skills, jobs differ in their attributes, and information about job candidates and job   \f 300 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   vacancies is disseminated slowly among the many firms and households in the  economy.WHY SOME FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT IS INEVITABLE   Frictional unemployment is often the result of changes in the demand for labor  among different firms.When consumers decide that they prefer Compaq over Dell  computers, Compaq increases employment, and Dell lays off workers.The former  Dell workers must now search for new jobs, and Compaq must decide which new  workers to hire for the various jobs that have opened up.The result of this transition  is a period of unemployment.Similarly, because different regions of the country produce different goods,  employment can rise in one region while it falls in another.Consider, for instance,  what happens when the world price of oil falls.Oil-producing firms in Texas respond  to the lower price by cutting back on production and employment.At the  same time, cheaper gasoline stimulates car sales, so auto-producing firms in  Michigan raise production and employment.Changes in the composition of demand  among industries or regions are called sectoral shifts.Because it takes time for  workers to search for jobs in the new sectors, sectoral shifts temporarily cause unemployment.Frictional unemployment is inevitable simply because the economy is always  changing.A century ago, the four industries with the largest employment in the  United States were cotton goods, woolen goods, men\u2019s clothing, and lumber.Today,  the four largest industries are autos, aircraft, communications, and electrical  components.As this transition took place, jobs were created in some firms, and  jobs were destroyed in others.The end result of this process has been higher productivity  and higher living standards.But, along the way, workers in declining industries  found themselves out of work and searching for new jobs.Data show that at least 10 percent of U.S. manufacturing jobs are destroyed  every year.In addition, more than 3 percent of workers leave their jobs in a typical  month, sometimes because they realize that the jobs are not a good match for their  tastes and skills.Many of these workers, especially younger ones, find new jobs  at higher wages.This churning of the labor force is normal in a well-functioning  and dynamic market economy, but the result is some amount of frictional  unemployment.PUBLIC POLICY AND JOB SEARCH   Even if some frictional unemployment is inevitable, the precise amount is not.The  faster information spreads about job openings and worker availability, the more  rapidly the economy can match workers and firms.The Internet, for instance, may  help facilitate job search and reduce frictional unemployment.In addition, public  policy may play a role.If policy can reduce the time it takes unemployed workers  to find new jobs, it can reduce the economy\u2019s natural rate of unemployment.Government programs try to facilitate job search in various ways.One way is  through government-run employment agencies, which give out information about  job vacancies.Another way is through public training programs, which aim to  ease the transition of workers from declining to growing industries and to help   \f CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 301   disadvantaged groups escape poverty.Advocates of these programs believe that  they make the economy operate more efficiently by keeping the labor force more  fully employed, and that they reduce the inequities inherent in a constantly changing  market economy.Critics of these programs question whether the government should get involved  with the process of job search.They argue that it is better to let the private  market match workers and jobs.In fact, most job search in our economy takes  place without intervention by the government.Newspaper ads, job newsletters,  college placement offices, headhunters, and word of mouth all help spread information  about job openings and job candidates.Similarly, much worker education  is done privately, either through schools or through on-the-job training.These critics  contend that the government is no better\u2014and most likely worse\u2014at disseminating  the right information to the right workers and deciding what kinds of  worker training would be most valuable.They claim that these decisions are best  made privately by workers and employers.UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE   One government program that increases the amount of frictional unemployment,  without intending to do so, is unemployment insurance.This program is de-unemployment insurance  signed to offer workers partial protection against job loss.The unemployed who a government program that partially  quit their jobs, were fired for cause, or just entered the labor force are not eligible.protects workers\u2019 incomes when  Benefits are paid only to the unemployed who were laid off because their previous they become unemployed  employers no longer needed their skills.Although the terms of the program vary  over time and across states, a typical American worker covered by unemployment  insurance receives 50 percent of his or her former wages for 26 weeks.While unemployment insurance reduces the hardship of unemployment, it   also increases the amount of unemployment.The explanation is based on one of  the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1: People respond to incentives.Because  unemployment benefits stop when a worker takes a new job, the unemployed devote  less effort to job search and are more likely to turn down unattractive job offers.In addition, because unemployment insurance makes unemployment less    onerous, workers are less likely to seek guarantees of job security when they negotiate  with employers over the terms of employment.Many studies by labor economists have examined the incentive effects of unemployment  insurance.One study examined an experiment run by the state of Illinois  in 1985.When unemployed workers applied to collect unemployment  insurance benefits, the state randomly selected some of them and offered each a  $500 bonus if they found new jobs within 11 weeks.This group was then compared  to a control group not offered the incentive.The average spell of unemployment  for the group offered the bonus was 7 percent shorter than the average spell  for the control group.This experiment shows that the design of the unemployment  insurance system influences the effort that the unemployed devote to job search.Several other studies examined search effort by following a group of workers  over time.Unemployment insurance benefits, rather than lasting forever, usually  run out after six months or a year.These studies found that when the unemployed  become ineligible for benefits, the probability of their finding a new job rises  markedly.Thus, receiving unemployment insurance benefits does reduce the  search effort of the unemployed.302 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   IN THE NEWS  German Unemployment  MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES HAVE UN- employment insurance that is far more  generous than that offered to U.S.  workers, and some economists believe  that these programs explain the high  European unemployment rates.The  following article discusses the recent  debate over unemployment insurance  in Germany.For Germany,  Benefits Are Also a Burden   BY ELIZABETH NEUFFER  BERLIN\u2014They grumble and grouse as  they wait for their benefit checks at a  local unemployment office here\u2014about  the lack of jobs, about the stupidity of  German politicians, about how outrageously  high taxes are.What today\u2019s unemployed Germans  don\u2019t complain about is this: the size of  their benefit checks.\u201cI get unemployment benefits, I  make some money working on the black  market, I make a living,\u201d says Michael  Steinbach, a 30-year-old electrician who  sports a well-ironed shirt, fashionable  glasses, and a briefcase as he waits his  turn at the Prenzlauer Berg unemployment  office.\u201cFor now, it\u2019s comfortable.\u201d   Germany\u2019s social welfare system  takes good care of the jobless, with initial  average monthly checks of nearly  $900 per month for someone married\u2014   and the prospect, for those who know  how to work the system, of remaining on  benefits for life.So blatantly do people  abuse this system that Chancellor Helmut  Kohl once critically described his  country as \u201cLeisurepark Germany.\u201d .Now\u2014partly because .such generous  benefits are seriously straining the  nation\u2019s economy\u2014questions are being  raised about whether one way to combat  unemployment is to reform the social  welfare system itself.Combating unemployment, always a  hot topic here, leapt back into public debate  last week, after the German Labor  office released figures showing that joblessness  inched up to 11.7 percent in  September, the fifth consecutive postwar  record.The unease here also stems from  memories of when Germany last faced  such levels of joblessness: 1933, when  the unemployed were so desperate they  begged in the streets for spare change,  relied on soup kitchens for meals, and  ushered the Nazis into power.Postwar Germany\u2019s reaction was to  create a massive welfare state, designed  to squelch social unrest through social  benevolence.\u201cIt\u2019s more important to  have modestly happy people on benefits  than poverty and all its side effects such  as a high crime rate as in the United  States,\u201d said Heiner Geissler, a leading  figure in the ruling CDU party.It is becoming increasingly clear,  though, that preserving benefits has  trapped Germany in something of a vicious  circle.The nation\u2019s high-cost social welfare  system is one reason its labor costs are  among the highest in the world: Both  employees and employers must pay  generously into the system, so they  need higher wages and profits.More  than half of a worker\u2019s paycheck goes to   taxes.Employer/employee-funded taxes  this year alone totaled 52.8 billion  deutsche marks, or nearly $30 billion.But high labor costs are a major  reason companies are now fleeing for  cheaper, neighboring Poland\u2014meaning  job losses for Germany.At the same  time, unemployment benefits have become  something of a velvet coffin for the  unemployed, discouraging them from  taking jobs.Until recently, workers who  worked part-time were effectively penalized,  as they would receive less unemployment  benefits if they were laid off.And generous unemployment benefits  mean there is no incentive to take  part-time or low-paid work\u2014a strategy  adopted to fight unemployment in  other countries, including the United  States.These benefits are so good that exploiting  them is something of a national  sport.In a recent, and not uncommon,  conversation overheard in a Berlin cafe,  a woman bragged about how she was  using her Sozialhilfe to pay for a vacation  in Italy.Some Germans even register in  several districts, knowing it\u2019s unlikely  they will be caught for receiving multiple  benefits.Not surprisingly, more than 60 percent  of Germany\u2019s unemployed are longterm  unemployed.\u201cPeople are used to, and heavily  rely on, \u2018Father State,\u2019 \u201d said Dieter  Hundt, president of the Confederation of  Germany Employers\u2019 Association.\u201cWe  are a bit spoiled by a too tightly woven  social net, which doesn\u2019t encourage the  individual enough to improve his own  situation.\u201d   SOURCE: The Boston Globe, October 12, 1997, p. F1.CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 303   Even though unemployment insurance reduces search effort and raises unemployment,  we should not necessarily conclude that the policy is a bad one.The  program does achieve its primary goal of reducing the income uncertainty that  workers face.In addition, when workers turn down unattractive job offers, they  have the opportunity to look for jobs that better suit their tastes and skills.Some  economists have argued that unemployment insurance improves the ability of the  economy to match each worker with the most appropriate job.The study of unemployment insurance shows that the unemployment rate is  an imperfect measure of a nation\u2019s overall level of economic well-being.Most  economists agree that eliminating unemployment insurance would reduce the  amount of unemployment in the economy.Yet economists disagree on whether  economic well-being would be enhanced or diminished by this change in policy.QUICK QUIZ: How would an increase in the world price of oil affect the  amount of frictional unemployment?Is this unemployment undesirable?What public policies might affect the amount of unemployment caused by this  price change?MINIMUM-WAGE LAWS  Having seen how frictional unemployment results from the process of matching  workers and jobs, let\u2019s now examine how structural unemployment results when  the number of jobs is insufficient for the number of workers.To understand structural unemployment, we begin by reviewing how unemployment  arises from minimum-wage laws\u2014a topic we first analyzed in  Chapter 6.Although minimum wages are not the predominant reason for unemployment  in our economy, they have an important effect on certain groups with  particularly high unemployment rates.Moreover, the analysis of minimum wages  is a natural place to start because, as we will see, it can be used to understand some  of the other reasons for structural unemployment.Figure 14-4 reviews the basic economics of a minimum wage.When a  minimum-wage law forces the wage to remain above the level that balances supply  and demand, it raises the quantity of labor supplied and reduces the quantity  of labor demanded compared to the equilibrium level.There is a surplus of labor.Because there are more workers willing to work than there are jobs, some workers  are unemployed.Because we discussed minimum-wage laws extensively in Chapter 6, we will  not discuss them further here.It is, however, important to note why minimum- wage laws are not a predominant reason for unemployment: Most workers in the  economy have wages well above the legal minimum.Minimum-wage laws are  binding most often for the least skilled and least experienced members of the labor  force, such as teenagers.It is only among these workers that minimum-wage laws  explain the existence of unemployment.Although Figure 14-4 is drawn to show the effects of a minimum-wage law, it  also illustrates a more general lesson: If the wage is kept above the equilibrium level for  any reason, the result is unemployment.Minimum-wage laws are just one reason why   \f 304 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   Figure 14-4  UNEMPLOYMENT FROM A  WAGE ABOVE THE EQUILIBRIUM  LEVEL.In this labor market,  the wage at which supply and  demand balance is WE.At this  equilibrium wage, the quantity of  labor supplied and the quantity  of labor demanded both equal LE.By contrast, if the wage is forced  to remain above the equilibrium  level, perhaps because of a  minimum-wage law, the quantity  of labor supplied rises to LS, and  the quantity of labor demanded  falls to LD.The resulting surplus  of labor, LS\u2013LD, represents  unemployment.WE  Quantity of  Labor  LE 0  Surplus of labor  Unemployment  Labor  supply

level\u2014  unions and efficiency wages.The basic economics of unemployment in these cases  is the same as that shown in Figure 14-4, but these explanations of unemployment  can apply to many more of the economy\u2019s workers.At this point, however, we should stop and notice that the structural unemployment  that arises from an above-equilibrium wage is, in an important sense,  different from the frictional unemployment that arises from the process of job  search.The need for job search is not due to the failure of wages to balance labor  supply and labor demand.When job search is the explanation for unemployment,  workers are searching for the jobs that best suit their tastes and skills.By contrast,  when the wage is above the equilibrium level, the quantity of labor supplied exceeds  the quantity of labor demanded, and workers are unemployed because they  are waiting for jobs to open up.QUICK QUIZ: Draw the supply curve and the demand curve for a labor  market in which

that bargains  with employers over wages and A union is a worker association that bargains with employers over wages and  working conditions working conditions.Whereas only 16 percent of U.S. workers now belong to   \f CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 305   unions, unions played a much larger role in the U.S. labor market in the past.In  the 1940s and 1950s, when unions were at their peak, about a third of the U.S. labor  force was unionized.Moreover, unions continue to play a large role in many  European countries.In Sweden and Denmark, for instance, more than three- fourths of workers belong to unions.THE ECONOMICS OF UNIONS   A union is a type of cartel.Like any cartel, a union is a group of sellers acting together  in the hope of exerting their joint market power.Most workers in the U.S.  economy discuss their wages, benefits, and working conditions with their employers  as individuals.By contrast, workers in a union do so as a group.The  process by which unions and firms agree on the terms of employment is called col-collective bargaining  lective bargaining.the process by which unions   When a union bargains with a firm, it asks for higher wages, better benefits, and firms agree on the  and better working conditions than the firm would offer in the absence of a union.terms of employment  If the union and the firm do not reach agreement, the union can organize a withdrawal  of labor from the firm, called a strike.Because a strike reduces production, strike  sales, and profit, a firm facing a strike threat is likely to agree to pay higher wages the organized withdrawal of  than it otherwise would.Economists who study the effects of unions typically find labor from a firm by a union  that union workers earn about 10 to 20 percent more than similar workers who do  not belong to unions.When a union raises the wage above the equilibrium level, it raises the quantity  of labor supplied and reduces the quantity of labor demanded, resulting in unemployment.Those workers who remain employed are better off, but those who  were previously employed and are now unemployed at the higher wage are worse  off.Indeed, unions are often thought to cause conflict between different groups of  workers\u2014between the insiders who benefit from high union wages and the outsiders  who do not get the union jobs.The outsiders can respond to their status in one of two ways.Some of them  remain unemployed and wait for the chance to become insiders and earn the high  union wage.Others take jobs in firms that are not unionized.Thus, when unions  raise wages in one part of the economy, the supply of labor increases in other parts  of the economy.This increase in labor supply, in turn, reduces wages in industries  that are not unionized.In other words, workers in unions reap the benefit of collective  bargaining, while workers not in unions bear some of the cost.The role of unions in the economy depends in part on the laws that govern  union organization and collective bargaining.Normally, explicit agreements  among members of a cartel are illegal.If firms that sell a common product were to  agree to set a high price for that product, the agreement would be a \u201cconspiracy in  restraint of trade.\u201d The government would prosecute these firms in civil and criminal  court for violating the antitrust laws.By contrast, unions are exempt from  these laws.The policymakers who wrote the antitrust laws believed that workers  needed greater market power as they bargained with employers.Indeed, various  laws are designed to encourage the formation of unions.In particular, the Wagner  Act of 1935 prevents employers from interfering when workers try to organize  unions and requires employers to bargain with unions in good faith.The National  Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is the government agency that enforces workers\u2019  right to unionize.306 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN    \u201cGentlemen, nothing stands in the way of a final accord except that management  wants profit maximization and the union wants more moola.\u201d   Legislation affecting the market power of unions is a perennial topic of political  debate.State lawmakers sometimes debate right-to-work laws, which give workers  in a unionized firm the right to choose whether to join the union.In the absence  of such laws, unions can insist during collective bargaining that firms make union  membership a requirement for employment.In recent years, lawmakers in Washington  have debated a proposed law that would prevent firms from hiring permanent  replacements for workers who are on strike.This law would make strikes  more costly for firms and, thereby, would increase the market power of unions.These and similar policy decisions will help determine the future of the union  movement.ARE UNIONS GOOD OR BAD FOR THE ECONOMY?Economists disagree about whether unions are good or bad for the economy as a  whole.Let\u2019s consider both sides of the debate.Critics of unions argue that unions are merely a type of cartel.When unions  raise wages above the level that would prevail in competitive markets, they reduce  the quantity of labor demanded, cause some workers to be unemployed, and reduce  the wages in the rest of the economy.The resulting allocation of labor is, critics  argue, both inefficient and inequitable.It is inefficient because high union  wages reduce employment in unionized firms below the efficient, competitive  level.It is inequitable because some workers benefit at the expense of other  workers.CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 307   IN THE NEWS  Should You Join a Union?SOMEDAY YOU MAY FACE THE DECISION  about whether to vote for or against a  union in your workplace.The following  article discusses some issues you  might consider.On Payday,  Union Jobs Stack Up Very Well   BY DAVID CAY JOHNSTON  With the teamsters\u2019 success in their  two-week strike against United Parcel  Service, and with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.training  thousands of union organizers in a  drive to reverse a quarter-century of declining  membership, millions of workers  will be asked over the next few years  whether they want a union to represent  them.It is a complicated question, the answer  to which rests on a jumble of determinations:  Do you favor collective action  or individual initiative?Do you trust the  union\u2019s leaders?Do you want somebody  else speaking for you in dealings with  your employer?Do you think you will be  dismissed if you sign a union card\u2014or  that the company will send your job overseas  if a union is organized?But in one regard, the choice is sim- ple\u2014and it is not the choice that most  workers have made during the labor  movement\u2019s recent decades in the economic  wilderness.From a pocketbook perspective,  workers are absolutely better off joining  a union.Economists across the political  spectrum agree.Turning a nonunion job  into a union job very likely will have a bigger  effect on lifetime finances than all the  advice employees will ever read about investing  their 401(k) plans, buying a  home or otherwise making more of what  they earn.Here is how the equation works,  said Prof. Richard B. Freeman of Harvard  University: \u201cFor an existing worker in a  firm, if you can carry out an organizing  drive, it is all to your benefit.If there are  going to be losers, they are people who  might have gotten a job in the future, the  shareholders whose profits will go down,  the managers because there will be less  profit to distribute to them in pay and,  maybe, consumers will pay a little more  for the product.But as a worker, it is awfully  hard to see why you wouldn\u2019t want a  union.\u201d   Overall, union workers are paid  about 20 percent more than nonunion  workers, and their fringe benefits are  typically worth two to four times as  much, economists with a wide array of  views have found.The financial advantage  is even greater for workers with little  formal education and training and for  women, blacks, and Hispanic workers.Moreover, 85 percent of union  members have health insurance, compared  with 57 percent of nonunion  workers, said Barry Bluestone, a labor- friendly economics professor at the University  of Massachusetts.The conclusion draws no argument  even from Prof. Leo Troy of Rutgers University,  who is widely known in academic  circles and among union leaders for his  hostility to organized labor.\u201cFrom a  standpoint of wages and fringe bene   fits,\u201d Professor Troy said, \u201cthe answer is  yes, you are better off in a union.\u201d   His objections to unions concern  how they reduce profits for owners and  distort investment decisions in ways that  slow the overall growth of the econ- omy\u2014not how they affect workers who  bargain collectively.Professor Troy  points out that he belongs to a union  himself\u2014the American Association of  University Professors.Donald R. Deere, an economist at  the Bush School of Government and  Public Service at Texas A & M University,  studied the wage differential for comparable  union and nonunion workers between  1974 and 1996, a period when  union membership fell to 15 percent of  American workers from 22 percent.In every educational and age category  that he studied, Professor Deere  found that union members increased  their wage advantage over nonunion  workers during those years.Last year,  he estimates, unionized workers with  less than a high school education earned  22 percent more than their nonunion  counterparts.The differential declined as  education levels rose, reaching 10 percent  for college graduates.\u201cIt makes sense to belong to a  union,\u201d Professor Deere said, \u201cso long  as you don\u2019t lose your job in the long  term.\u201d   Source: The New York Times, Money & Business  Section, August 31, 1997, p. 1.308 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   efficiency wages   above-equilibrium wages paid  by firms in order to increase  worker productivity   Advocates of unions contend that unions are a necessary antidote to the market  power of the firms that hire workers.The extreme case of this market power is  the \u201ccompany town,\u201d where a single firm does most of the hiring in a geographic  region.In a company town, if workers do not accept the wages and working conditions  that the firm offers, they have little choice but to move or stop working.In  the absence of a union, therefore, the firm could use its market power to pay lower  wages and offer worse working conditions than would prevail if it had to compete  with other firms for the same workers.In this case, a union may balance the  firm\u2019s market power and protect the workers from being at the mercy of the firm  owners.Advocates of unions also claim that unions are important for helping firms respond  efficiently to workers\u2019 concerns.Whenever a worker takes a job, the worker  and the firm must agree on many attributes of the job in addition to the wage:  hours of work, overtime, vacations, sick leave, health benefits, promotion schedules,  job security, and so on.By representing workers\u2019 views on these issues,  unions allow firms to provide the right mix of job attributes.Even if unions have  the adverse effect of pushing wages above the equilibrium level and causing unemployment,  they have the benefit of helping firms keep a happy and productive  workforce.In the end, there is no consensus among economists about whether unions are  good or bad for the economy.Like many institutions, their influence is probably  beneficial in some circumstances and adverse in others.QUICK QUIZ: How does a union in the auto industry affect wages and  employment at General Motors and Ford?How does it affect wages and  employment in other industries?THE THEORY OF EFFICIENCY WAGES  A fourth reason why economies always experience some unemployment\u2014in addition  to job search, minimum-wage laws, and unions\u2014is suggested by the theory  of efficiency wages.According to this theory, firms operate more efficiently if  wages are above the equilibrium level.Therefore, it may be profitable for firms to  keep wages high even in the presence of a surplus of labor.In some ways, the unemployment that arises from efficiency wages is similar  to the unemployment that arises from minimum-wage laws and unions.In all  three cases, unemployment is the result of wages above the level that balances the  quantity of labor supplied and the quantity of labor demanded.Yet there is also  an important difference.Minimum-wage laws and unions prevent firms from  lowering wages in the presence of a surplus of workers.Efficiency-wage theory  states that such a constraint on firms is unnecessary in many cases because firms  may be better off keeping wages above the equilibrium level.Why should firms want to keep wages high?In some ways, this decision  seems odd, for wages are a large part of firms\u2019 costs.Normally, we expect profit- maximizing firms to want to keep costs\u2014and therefore wages\u2014as low as possible.CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 309   The novel insight of efficiency-wage theory is that paying high wages might be  profitable because they might raise the efficiency of a firm\u2019s workers.There are several types of efficiency-wage theory.Each type suggests a different  explanation for why firms may want to pay high wages.Let\u2019s now consider  four of these types.WORKER HEALTH   The first and simplest type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between  wages and worker health.Better paid workers eat a more nutritious diet, and  workers who eat a better diet are healthier and more productive.A firm may find  it more profitable to pay high wages and have healthy, productive workers than to  pay lower wages and have less healthy, less productive workers.This type of efficiency-wage theory is not relevant for firms in rich countries  such as the United States.In these countries, the equilibrium wages for most  workers are well above the level needed for an adequate diet.Firms are not  concerned that paying equilibrium wages would place their workers\u2019 health in  jeopardy.This type of efficiency-wage theory is more relevant for firms in less developed  countries where inadequate nutrition is a more common problem.Unemployment  is high in the cities of many poor African countries, for example.In these  countries, firms may fear that cutting wages would, in fact, adversely influence  their workers\u2019 health and productivity.In other words, concern over nutrition may  explain why firms do not cut wages despite a surplus of labor.WORKER TURNOVER   A second type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wages and  worker turnover.Workers quit jobs for many reasons\u2014to take jobs in other firms,  to move to other parts of the country, to leave the labor force, and so on.The frequency  with which they quit depends on the entire set of incentives they face, including  the benefits of leaving and the benefits of staying.The more a firm pays its  workers, the less often its workers will choose to leave.Thus, a firm can reduce  turnover among its workers by paying them a high wage.Why do firms care about turnover?The reason is that it is costly for firms to  hire and train new workers.Moreover, even after they are trained, newly hired  workers are not as productive as experienced workers.Firms with higher  turnover, therefore, will tend to have higher production costs.Firms may find it  profitable to pay wages above the equilibrium level in order to reduce worker  turnover.WORKER EFFORT   A third type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between wages  and worker effort.In many jobs, workers have some discretion over how hard to  work.As a result, firms monitor the efforts of their workers, and workers caught   \f 310 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   shirking their responsibilities are fired.But not all shirkers are caught immediately  because monitoring workers is costly and imperfect.A firm can respond to this  problem by paying wages above the equilibrium level.High wages make workers  more eager to keep their jobs and, thereby, give workers an incentive to put forward  their best effort.This particular type of efficiency-wage theory is similar to the old Marxist idea  of the \u201creserve army of the unemployed.\u201d Marx thought that employers benefited  from unemployment because the threat of unemployment helped to discipline  those workers who had jobs.In the worker-effort variant of efficiency-wage theory,  unemployment fills a similar role.If the wage were at the level that balanced supply  and demand, workers would have less reason to work hard because if they  were fired, they could quickly find new jobs at the same wage.Therefore, firms  raise wages above the equilibrium level, causing unemployment and providing an  incentive for workers not to shirk their responsibilities.WORKER QUALITY   A fourth and final type of efficiency-wage theory emphasizes the link between  wages and worker quality.When a firm hires new workers, it cannot perfectly  gauge the quality of the applicants.By paying a high wage, the firm attracts a better  pool of workers to apply for its jobs.To see how this might work, consider a simple example.Waterwell Company  owns one well and needs one worker to pump water from the well.Two workers,  Bill and Ted, are interested in the job.Bill, a proficient worker, is willing to work  for $10 per hour.Below that wage, he would rather start his own lawn-mowing  business.Ted, a complete incompetent, is willing to work for anything above $2  per hour.Below that wage, he would rather sit on the beach.Economists say that  Bill\u2019s reservation wage\u2014the lowest wage he would accept\u2014is $10, and Ted\u2019s reservation  wage is $2.What wage should the firm set?If the firm were interested in minimizing  labor costs, it would set the wage at $2 per hour.At this wage, the quantity of  workers supplied (one) would balance the quantity demanded.Ted would take  the job, and Bill would not apply for it.Yet suppose Waterwell knows that only  one of these two applicants is competent, but it does not know whether it is Bill or  Ted.If the firm hires the incompetent worker, he will damage the well, causing  the firm huge losses.In this case, the firm has a better strategy than paying the   DILBERT\u00ae By Scott Adams   \f CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 311   equilibrium wage of $2 and hiring Ted.It can offer $10 per hour, inducing both Bill  and Ted to apply for the job.By choosing randomly between these two applicants  and turning the other away, the firm has a fifty-fifty chance of hiring the competent  one.By contrast, if the firm offers any lower wage, it is sure to hire the incompetent  worker.In many situations in life, in- formation is asymmetric: One  person in a transaction knows  more about what is going on  than the other person.This  possibility raises a variety of  interesting problems for eco- nomic theory.Some of these  problems were highlighted in  our description of the theory of  efficiency wages.These prob- lems, however, go beyond the  study of unemployment.The worker-quality variant  of efficiency-wage theory illus- trates a general principle called adverse selection.Adverse  selection arises when one person knows more about the at- tributes of a good than another and, as a result, the unin- formed person runs the risk of being sold a good of low  quality.In the case of worker quality, for instance, workers  have better information about their own abilities than firms  do.When a firm cuts the wage it pays, the selection of work- ers changes in a way that is adverse to the firm.Adverse selection arises in many other circumstances.Here are two examples:  \u0001Sellers of used cars know their vehicles\u2019 defects,  whereas buyers often do not.Because owners of the  worst cars are more likely to sell them than are the  owners of the best cars, buyers are correctly apprehen- sive about getting a \u201clemon.\u201d As a result, many people  avoid buying cars in the used car market.\u0001Buyers of health insurance know more about their own  health problems than do insurance companies.Be- cause people with greater hidden health problems are  more likely to buy health insurance than are other peo- ple, the price of health insurance reflects the costs of a  sicker-than-average person.As a result, people with av- erage health problems are discouraged by the high  price from buying health insurance.In each case, the market for the product\u2014used cars or  health insurance\u2014does not work as well as it might be- cause of the problem of adverse selection.Similarly, the worker-effort variant of efficiency-wage  theory illustrates a general phenomenon called moral haz- ard.Moral hazard arises when one person, called the agent,  is performing some task on behalf of another person, called  the principal.Because the principal cannot perfectly monitor  the agent\u2019s behavior, the agent tends to undertake less ef- fort than the principal considers desirable.The term moral  hazard refers to the risk of dishonest or otherwise inappro- priate behavior by the agent.In such a situation, the princi- pal tries various ways to encourage the agent to act more  responsibly.In an employment relationship, the firm is the principal  and the worker is the agent.The moral-hazard problem is  the temptation of imperfectly monitored workers to shirk  their responsibilities.According to the worker-effort variant  of efficiency-wage theory, the principal can encourage the  agent not to shirk by paying a wage above the equilibrium  level because then the agent has more to lose if caught  shirking.In this way, high wages reduce the problem of  moral hazard.Moral hazard arises in many other situations.Here are  some examples:  \u0001A homeowner with fire insurance buys too few fire ex- tinguishers.The reason is that the homeowner bears  the cost of the extinguisher while the insurance com- pany receives much of the benefit.\u0001A babysitter allows children to watch more television  than the parents of the children prefer.The reason is  that more educational activities require more energy  from the babysitter, even though they are beneficial for  the children.\u0001A family lives near a river with a high risk of flooding.The reason it continues to live there is that the family  enjoys the scenic views, and the government will bear  part of the cost when it provides disaster relief after  a flood.Can you identify the principal and the agent in each of these  three situations?How do you think the principal in each  case might solve the problem of moral hazard?FYI  The Economics  of Asymmetric  Information  \f 312 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   This story illustrates a general phenomenon.When a firm faces a surplus of  workers, it might seem profitable to reduce the wage it is offering.But by reducing  the wage, the firm induces an adverse change in the mix of workers.In this case,  at a wage of $10, Waterwell has two workers applying for one job.But if Waterwell  responds to this labor surplus by reducing the wage, the competent worker (who  has better alternative opportunities) will not apply.Thus, it is profitable for the  firm to pay a wage above the level that balances supply and demand.CASE STUDY HENRY FORD AND THE VERY GENEROUS  $5-A-DAY WAGE   Henry Ford was an industrial visionary.As founder of the Ford Motor Company,  he was responsible for introducing modern techniques of production.Rather than building cars with small teams of skilled craftsmen, Ford built cars  on assembly lines in which unskilled workers were taught to perform the same  simple tasks over and over again.The output of this assembly process was the  Model T Ford, one of the most famous early automobiles.In 1914, Ford introduced another innovation: the $5 workday.This might  not seem like much today, but back then $5 was about twice the going wage.It  was also far above the wage that balanced supply and demand.When the new  $5-a-day wage was announced, long lines of job seekers formed outside the  Ford factories.The number of workers willing to work at this wage far exceeded  the number of workers Ford needed.Ford\u2019s high-wage policy had many of the effects predicted by efficiency- wage theory.Turnover fell, absenteeism fell, and productivity rose.Workers  were so much more efficient that Ford\u2019s production costs were lower even  though wages were higher.Thus, paying a wage above the equilibrium level   WORKERS OUTSIDE AN EARLY FORD FACTORY    \f CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 313   was profitable for the firm.Henry Ford himself called the $5-a-day wage \u201cone  of the finest cost-cutting moves we ever made.\u201d   Historical accounts of this episode are also consistent with efficiency-wage  theory.An historian of the early Ford Motor Company wrote, \u201cFord and his associates  freely declared on many occasions that the high-wage policy turned out  to be good business.By this they meant that it had improved the discipline of  the workers, given them a more loyal interest in the institution, and raised their  personal efficiency.\u201d   Why did it take Henry Ford to introduce this efficiency wage?Why were  other firms not already taking advantage of this seemingly profitable business  strategy?According to some analysts, Ford\u2019s decision was closely linked to his  use of the assembly line.Workers organized in an assembly line are highly interdependent.If one worker is absent or works slowly, other workers are less  able to complete their own tasks.Thus, while assembly lines made production  more efficient, they also raised the importance of low worker turnover, high  worker quality, and high worker effort.As a result, paying efficiency wages  may have been a better strategy for the Ford Motor Company than for other  businesses at the time.QUICK QUIZ: Give four explanations for why firms might find it  profitable to pay wages above the level that balances quantity of labor  supplied and quantity of labor demanded.CONCLUSION  In this chapter we discussed the measurement of unemployment and the reasons  why economies always experience some degree of unemployment.We have seen  how job search, minimum-wage laws, unions, and efficiency wages can all help explain  why some workers do not have jobs.Which of these four explanations for the  natural rate of unemployment are the most important for the U.S. economy and  other economies around the world?Unfortunately, there is no easy way to tell.Economists differ in which of these explanations of unemployment they consider  most important.The analysis of this chapter yields an important lesson: Although the economy  will always have some unemployment, its natural rate is not immutable.Many  events and policies can change the amount of unemployment the economy typically  experiences.As the information revolution changes the process of job search,  as Congress adjusts the minimum wage, as workers form or quit unions, and as  firms alter their reliance on efficiency wages, the natural rate of unemployment  evolves.Unemployment is not a simple problem with a simple solution.But how  we choose to organize our society can profoundly influence how prevalent a problem  it is.314 PART FIVE THE REAL ECONOMY IN THE LONG RUN   Summary  The unemployment rate is the percentage of those who  would like to work who do not have jobs.The Bureau of  Labor Statistics calculates this statistic monthly based on  a survey of thousands of households.The unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of  joblessness.Some people who call themselves  unemployed may actually not want to work, and some  people who would like to work have left the labor force  after an unsuccessful search.In the U.S. economy, most people who become  unemployed find work within a short period of time.Nonetheless, most unemployment observed at any  given time is attributable to the few people who are  unemployed for long periods of time.One reason for unemployment is the time it takes for  workers to search for jobs that best suit their tastes and  skills.Unemployment insurance is a government policy  that, while protecting workers\u2019 incomes, increases the  amount of frictional unemployment.A second reason why our economy always has some  unemployment is minimum-wage laws.By raising the  wage of unskilled and inexperienced workers above the  equilibrium level, minimum-wage laws raise the  quantity of labor supplied and reduce the quantity  demanded.The resulting surplus of labor represents  unemployment.A third reason for unemployment is the market power  of unions.When unions push the wages in unionized  industries above the equilibrium level, they create a  surplus of labor.A fourth reason for unemployment is suggested by the  theory of efficiency wages.According to this theory,  firms find it profitable to pay wages above the  equilibrium level.High wages can improve worker  health, lower worker turnover, increase worker effort,  and raise worker quality.Key Concepts  labor force,

rate?Is unemployment typically short-term or long-term?Why is frictional unemployment inevitable?How might  the government reduce the amount of frictional  unemployment?Are minimum-wage laws a better

unions are good for the economy?Explain four ways in which a firm might increase its  profits by raising the wages it pays.CHAPTER 14 UNEMPLOYMENT AND ITS NATURAL RATE 315   Problems and Applications  1.The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that in  December 1998, of all adult Americans, 138,547,000 were  employed, 6,021,000 were unemployed, and 67,723,000  were not in the labor force.How big was the labor  force?What was the labor-force participation rate?What was the unemployment rate?As shown in Figure 14-3, the overall labor-force  participation rate of men declined between 1970 and  1990.This overall decline reflects different patterns  for different age groups, however, as shown in the  following table.MEN MEN MEN  ALL MEN 16\u201324 25\u201354 55 AND OVER   1970 80% 69% 96% 56%  1990 76 72 93 40   Which group experienced the largest decline?Given this  information, what factor may have played an important  role in the decline in overall male labor-force  participation over this period?The labor-force participation rate of women increased  sharply between 1970 and 1990, as shown in Figure 14-3.As with men, however, there were different patterns for  different age groups, as shown in this table.ALL WOMEN WOMEN WOMEN WOMEN  WOMEN 25-54 25-34 35-44 45-54   1970 43% 50% 45% 51% 54%  199058 74 74 77 71   Why do you think that younger women experienced  a bigger increase in labor-force participation than  older women?Between 1997 and 1998, total U.S. employment  increased by 2.1 million workers, but the number of  unemployed workers declined by only 0.5 million.How are these numbers consistent with each other?Why might one expect a reduction in the number of  people counted as unemployed to be smaller than the  increase in the number of people employed?Are the following workers more likely to experience  short-term or long-term unemployment?a. a construction worker laid off because of  bad weather  b. a manufacturing worker who loses her job at a  plant in an isolated area  c. a stagecoach-industry worker laid off because of  competition from railroads  d. a short-order cook who loses his job when a new  restaurant opens across the street  e. an expert welder with little formal education who  loses her job when the company installs automatic  welding machinery  6.Using a diagram of the labor market, show the effect of  an increase in the minimum wage on the wage paid to  workers, the number of workers supplied, the number  of workers demanded, and the amount of  unemployment.Do you think that firms in small towns or cities have  more market power in hiring?Do you think that firms  generally have more market power in hiring today than  50 years ago, or less?How do you think this change  over time has affected the role of unions in the  economy?Consider an economy with two labor markets, neither of  which is unionized.Now suppose a union is established  in one market.Show the effect of the union on the market in which  it is formed.In what sense is the quantity of labor  employed in this market an inefficient quantity?Show the effect of the union on the nonunionized  market.What happens to the equilibrium wage in  this market?It can be shown that an industry\u2019s demand for labor will  become more elastic when the demand for the  industry\u2019s product becomes more elastic.Let\u2019s consider  the implications of this fact for the U.S. automobile  industry and the auto workers\u2019 union (the UAW).What happened to the elasticity of demand for  American cars when the Japanese developed  a strong auto industry?What happened to the  elasticity of demand for American autoworkers?As the chapter explains, a union generally faces  a tradeoff in deciding how much to raise wages,  because a bigger increase is better for workers  who remain employed but also results in a greater  reduction in employment.How did the rise in auto  imports from Japan affect the wage-employment  tradeoff faced by

paper decorated with strange symbols, government buildings,  and the portraits of famous dead Americans.Or you might hand him a single  piece of paper with the name of a bank and your signature.Whether you pay by  cash or check, the restaurateur is happy to work hard to satisfy your gastronomical  desires in exchange for these pieces of paper which, in and of themselves, are  worthless.To anyone who has lived in a modern economy, this social custom is not at all  odd.Even though paper money has no intrinsic value, the restaurateur is confident  that, in the future, some third person will accept it in exchange for something  that the restaurateur does value.And that third person is confident that some  fourth person will accept the money, with the knowledge that yet a fifth person  will accept the money .and so on.To the restaurateur and to other people in our  society, your cash or check represents a claim to goods and services in the future.IN THIS CHAPTER  YOU

for meat loaf.An  economy that relies on barter will have trouble allocating its scarce resources  efficiently.In such an economy, trade is said to require the double coincidence of  wants\u2014the unlikely occurrence that two people each have a good or service that  the other wants.The existence of money makes trade easier.The restaurateur does not care  whether you can produce a valuable good or service for him.He is happy to accept  your money, knowing that other people will do the same for him.Such a convention  allows trade to be roundabout.The restaurateur accepts your money and uses  it to pay his chef; the chef uses her paycheck to send her child to day care; the day  care center uses this tuition to pay a teacher; and the teacher hires you to mow his  lawn.As money flows from person to person in the economy, it facilitates production  and trade, thereby allowing each person to specialize in what he or she does  best and raising everyone\u2019s standard of living.In this chapter we begin to examine the role of money in the economy.We discuss  what money is, the various forms that money takes, how the banking system  helps create money, and how the government controls the quantity of money in  circulation.Because money is so important in the economy, we devote much effort  in the rest of this book to learning how changes in the quantity of money affect  various economic variables, including inflation, interest rates, production, and employment.Consistent with our long-run focus in the previous three chapters, in the  next chapter we will examine the long-run effects of changes in the quantity of  money.The short-run effects of monetary changes are a more complex topic, which  we will take up later in the book.This chapter provides the background for all of  this further analysis.THE MEANING OF MONEY  What is money?This might seem like an odd question.When you read that billionaire  Bill Gates has a lot of money, you know what that means: He is so rich that  he can buy almost anything he wants.In this sense, the term money is used to mean  wealth.Economists, however, use the word in a more specific sense: Money is the set  of assets in the economy that people regularly use to buy goods and services from  other people.The cash in your wallet is money because you can use it to buy a  meal at a restaurant or a shirt at a clothing store.By contrast, if you happened to  own most of Microsoft Corporation, as Bill Gates does, you would be wealthy, but  this asset is not considered a form of money.You could not buy a meal or a shirt  with this wealth without first obtaining some cash.According to the economist\u2019s  definition, money includes only those few types of wealth that are regularly  accepted by sellers in exchange for goods and services.CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 321   THE FUNCTIONS OF MONEY   Money has three functions in the economy: It is a medium of exchange, a unit of account,  and a store of value.These three functions together distinguish money from  other assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, art, and even baseball cards.Let\u2019s  examine each of these functions of money in turn.A medium of exchange is an item that buyers give to sellers when they purchase  goods and services.When you buy a shirt at a clothing store, the store gives  you the shirt, and you give the store your money.This transfer of money from  buyer to seller allows the transaction to take place.When you walk into a store,  you are confident that the store will accept your money for the items it is selling  because money is the commonly accepted medium of exchange.A unit of account is the yardstick people use to post prices and record debts.When you go shopping, you might observe that a shirt costs $20 and a hamburger  costs $2.Even though it would be accurate to say that the price of a shirt is 10 hamburgers  and the price of a hamburger is 1/10 of a shirt, prices are never quoted in  this way.Similarly, if you take out a loan from a bank, the size of your future loan  repayments will be measured in dollars, not in a quantity of goods and services.When we want to measure and record economic value, we use money as the unit  of account.A store of value is an item that people can use to transfer purchasing power  from the present to the future.When a seller accepts money today in exchange for  a good or service, that seller can hold the money and become a buyer of another  good or service at another time.Of course, money is not the only store of value in  the economy, for a person can also transfer purchasing power from the present to  the future by holding other assets.The term wealth is used to refer to the total of all  stores of value, including both money and nonmonetary assets.Economists use the term liquidity to describe the ease with which an asset can  be converted into the economy\u2019s medium of exchange.Because money is the economy\u2019s  medium of exchange, it is the most liquid asset available.Other assets vary  widely in their liquidity.Most stocks and bonds can be sold easily with small cost,  so they are relatively liquid assets.By contrast, selling a house, a Rembrandt painting,  or a 1948 Joe DiMaggio baseball card requires more time and effort, so these  assets are less liquid.When people decide in what form to hold their wealth, they have to balance  the liquidity of each possible asset against the asset\u2019s usefulness as a store of value.Money is the most liquid asset, but it is far from perfect as a store of value.When  prices rise, the value of money falls.In other words, when goods and services become  more expensive, each dollar in your wallet can buy less.This link between  the price level and the value of money will turn out to be important for understanding  how money affects the economy.THE KINDS OF MONEY   When money takes the form of a commodity with intrinsic value, it is called commodity  money.The term intrinsic value means that the item would have value  even if it were not used as money.One example of commodity money is gold.Gold has intrinsic value because it is used in industry and in the making of jewelry.Although today we no longer use gold as money, historically gold has been a  common form of money because it is relatively easy to carry, measure, and verify   medium of exchange   an item

into gold on demand), it is said to be operating under a gold standard.IN THE NEWS  Money on the Island of Yap  THE ROLE OF SOCIAL CUSTOM IN THE MON- etary system is most apparent in foreign  cultures with customs very  different from our own.The following  article describes the money on the island  of Yap.As you read the article, ask  yourself whether Yap is using a type of  commodity money, a type of fiat  money, or something in between.Fixed Assets, or Why a Loan  in Yap Is Hard to Roll Over   BY ART PINE  YAP, MICRONESIA\u2014On this tiny South Pacific  island, life is easy and the currency  is hard.Elsewhere, the world\u2019s troubled  monetary system creaks along; floating  exchange rates wreak havoc on currency  markets, and devaluations are commonplace.But on Yap the currency is as  solid as a rock.In fact, it is rock.Limestone  to be precise.For nearly 2,000 years the Yapese  have used large stone wheels to pay for  major purchases, such as land, canoes  and permissions to marry.Yap is a U.S.  trust territory, and the dollar is used in  grocery stores and gas stations.But reliance  on stone money, like the island\u2019s   ancient caste system and the traditional  dress of loincloths and grass skirts,  continues.Buying property with stones is  \u201cmuch easier than buying it with U.S.  dollars,\u201d says John Chodad, who recently  purchased a building lot with a 30inch  stone wheel.\u201cWe don\u2019t know the  value of the U.S. dollar.\u201d .Stone wheels don\u2019t make good  pocket money, so for small transactions,  Yapese use other forms of currency,  such as beer.Beer is proffered as payment  for all sorts of odd jobs, including  construction.The 10,000 people on Yap  consume 40,000 to 50,000 cases a  year, mostly of Budweiser.The people of Yap have been using  stone money ever since a Yapese warrior  named Anagumang first brought the  huge stones from limestone caverns on  neighboring Palau, some 1,500 to 2,000  years ago.Inspired by the moon, he  fashioned the stone into large circles.The rest is history.Yapese lean the stone wheels  against their houses or prop up rows of  them in village \u201cbanks.\u201d Most of the  stones are 2 1/2 to 5 feet in diameter,  but some are as much as 12 feet across.Each has a hole in the center so it can be  slipped onto the trunk of a fallen betel  nut tree and carried.It takes 20 men to  lift some stones.By custom, the stones are worthless  when broken.You never hear people  on Yap musing about wanting a piece  of the rock.Rather than risk a broken  stone\u2014or back\u2014Yapese tend to leave  the larger stones where they are and  make a mental accounting that the ownership  has been transferred\u2014much as   MONEY ON THE ISLAND OF YAP: NOT EXACTLY   POCKET CHANGE    gold bars used in international transactions  change hands without leaving the  vaults of the New York Federal Reserve  Bank.There are some decided advantages  to using massive stones for  money.They are immune to black- market trading, for one thing, and they  pose formidable obstacles to pickpockets.In addition, there aren\u2019t any  sterile debates about how to stabilize the  Yapese monetary system.With only  6,600 stone wheels remaining on the  island, the money supply stays put.Meanwhile, Yap\u2019s stone money may  be about to take on international significance.Just yesterday, Washington received  notice that Tosiho Nakayama, the  president of Micronesia, plans to bring a  stone disk when he visits the United  States next month.It will be flown by Air  Force jet.Officials say Mr. Nakayama intends  the stone as Micronesia\u2019s symbolic contribution  toward reducing the U.S. budget  deficit.SOURCE: The Wall Street Journal, March 29, 1984,  p. A1.CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 323   Another example of commodity money is cigarettes.In prisoner-of-war camps  during World War II, prisoners traded goods and services with one another using  cigarettes as the store of value, unit of account, and medium of exchange.Similarly,  as the Soviet Union was breaking up in the late 1980s, cigarettes started replacing  the ruble as the preferred currency in Moscow.In both cases, even  nonsmokers were happy to accept cigarettes in an exchange, knowing that they  could use the cigarettes to buy other goods and services.Money without intrinsic value is called fiat money.A fiat is simply an order or  decree, and fiat money is established as money by government decree.For example,  compare the paper dollars in your wallet (printed by the U.S. government)  and the paper dollars from a game of Monopoly (printed by the Parker Brothers  game company).Why can you use the first to pay your bill at a restaurant but not  the second?The answer is that the U.S. government has decreed its dollars to be  valid money.Each paper dollar in your wallet reads: \u201cThis note is legal tender for  all debts, public and private.\u201d   Although the government is central to establishing and regulating a system of  fiat money (by prosecuting counterfeiters, for example), other factors are also required  for the success of such a monetary system.To a large extent, the acceptance  of fiat money depends as much on expectations and social convention as on government  decree.The Soviet government in the 1980s never abandoned the ruble as  the official currency.Yet the people of Moscow preferred to accept cigarettes (or  even American dollars) in exchange for goods and services, because they were  more confident that these alternative monies would be accepted by others in the  future.MONEY IN THE U.S. ECONOMY   As we will see, the quantity of money circulating in the economy, called the money  stock, has a powerful influence on many economic variables.But before we consider  why that is true, we need to ask a preliminary question: What is the quantity  of money?In particular, suppose you were given the task of measuring how much  money there is in the U.S. economy.What would you include in your measure?The most obvious asset to include is currency\u2014the paper bills and coins in the  hands of the public.Currency is clearly the most widely accepted medium of exchange  in our economy.There is no doubt that it is part of the money stock.Yet currency is not the only asset that you can use to buy goods and services.Many stores also accept personal checks.Wealth held in your checking account is  almost as convenient for buying things as wealth held in your wallet.To measure  the money stock, therefore, you might want to include demand deposits\u2014  balances in bank accounts that depositors can access on demand simply by writing  a check.Once you start to consider balances in checking accounts as part of the money  stock, you are led to consider the large variety of other accounts that people hold  at banks and other financial institutions.Bank depositors usually cannot write  checks against the balances in their savings accounts, but they can easily transfer  funds from savings into checking accounts.In addition, depositors in money market  mutual funds can often write checks against their balances.Thus, these other  accounts should plausibly be part of the U.S. money stock.fiat money   money without intrinsic value  that is used as money because  of government decree   \u201cGee,

that can be called \u201cmoney\u201d and assets that cannot.The coins in your pocket are  clearly part of the money stock, and the Empire State Building clearly is not, but  there are many assets in between these extremes for which the choice is less clear.Therefore, various measures of the money stock are available for the U.S. economy.Table 15-1 shows the two most important, designated M1 and M2.Each of these  measures uses a slightly different criterion for distinguishing monetary and non- monetary assets.For our purposes in this book, we need not dwell on the differences between  the various measures of money.The important point is that the money stock for the   U.S. economy includes not just currency but also deposits in banks and other financial  institutions that can be readily accessed and used to buy goods and services.CASE STUDY WHERE IS ALL THE CURRENCY?One puzzle about the money stock of the U.S. economy concerns the amount of  currency.In 1998 there was about $460 billion of currency outstanding.To put  this number in perspective, we can divide it by 205 million, the number of  adults (age sixteen and over) in the United States.This calculation implies that  the average adult holds about $2,240 of currency.Most people are surprised to  learn that our economy has so much currency because they carry far less than  this in their wallets.Who is holding all this currency?No one knows for sure, but there are two  plausible explanations.The first explanation is that much of the currency is being held abroad.In  foreign countries without a stable monetary system, people often prefer U.S.  dollars to domestic assets.It is, in fact, not unusual to see U.S. dollars being  used overseas as the medium of exchange, unit of account, and store of value.The second explanation is that much of the currency is being held by drug  dealers, tax evaders, and other criminals.For most people in the U.S. economy,   \f CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 325   It might seem natural to in- clude credit cards as part of  the economy\u2019s stock of money.After all, people use credit  cards to make many of  their purchases.Aren\u2019t credit  cards, therefore, a medium of  exchange?Although at first this argu- ment may seem persuasive,  credit cards are excluded from  all measures of the quantity of  money.The reason is that  credit cards are not really a  method of payment but a method of deferringpayment.When you buy a meal with a credit card, the bank that is- sued the card pays the restaurant what it is due.At a later  date, you will have to repay the bank (perhaps with interest).When the time comes to pay your credit card bill, you will  probably do so by writing a check against your checking ac- count.The balance in this checking account is part of the  economy\u2019s stock of money.Notice that credit cards are very different from debit  cards, which automatically withdraw funds from a bank  account to pay for  items bought.Rather  than allowing the user  to postpone payment  for a purchase, a  debit card allows the  user immediate ac- cess to deposits in a  bank account.In this  sense, a debit card is  more similar to a  check than to a credit  card.The account balances that lie behind debit cards are  included in measures of the quantity of money.Even though credit cards are not considered a form of  money, they are nonetheless important for analyzing the  monetary system.People who have credit cards can pay  many of their bills all at once at the end of the month, rather  than sporadically as they make purchases.As a result, peo- ple who have credit cards probably hold less money on  average than people who do not have credit cards.Thus, the  introduction and increased popularity of credit cards may  reduce the amount of money that people choose to hold.IS THIS MONEY?FYI  Credit Cards,  Debit Cards,  and Money  currency is not a particularly good way to hold wealth.Not only can currency  be lost or stolen, but it also does not earn interest, whereas a bank deposit does.Thus, most people hold only small amounts of currency.By contrast, criminals  may avoid putting their wealth in banks, because a bank deposit gives police a  paper trail with which to trace their illegal activities.For criminals, currency  may be the best store of value available.QUICK QUIZ: List and describe the three functions of money.THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM  Whenever an economy relies on a system of fiat money, as the U.S. economy does,  some agency must be responsible for regulating the system.In the United States,  that agency is the Federal Reserve, often simply called the Fed.If you look at the  top of a dollar bill, you will see that it is called a \u201cFederal Reserve Note.\u201d The Fed  is an example of a central bank\u2014an institution designed to oversee the banking  system and regulate the quantity of money in the economy.Other major central   Federal Reserve (Fed)   the central bank of the United States   central bank   an institution designed to oversee  the banking system and regulate the  quantity of money in the economy   \f 326 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN   banks around the world include the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the  European Central Bank.THE FED\u2019S ORGANIZATION   The Federal Reserve was created in 1914, after a series of bank failures in 1907 convinced  Congress that the United States needed a central bank to ensure the health  of the nation\u2019s banking system.Today, the Fed is run by its Board of Governors,  which has seven members appointed by the president of the United States and  confirmed by the Senate.The governors have 14-year terms.Just as federal judges  are given lifetime appointments to insulate them from politics, Fed governors are  given long terms to give them independence from short-term political pressures  when they formulate monetary policy.Among the seven members of the Board of Governors, the most important is  the chairman.The chairman directs the Fed staff, presides over board meetings,  and testifies regularly about Fed policy in front of congressional committees.The  president appoints the chairman to a four-year term.As this book was going to  press, the chairman of the Fed was Alan Greenspan, who was originally appointed  in 1987 by President Reagan and later reappointed by Presidents Bush and  Clinton.The Federal Reserve System is made up of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington,  D.C., and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks located in major cities around  the country.The presidents of the regional banks are chosen by each bank\u2019s board  of directors, whose members are typically drawn from the region\u2019s banking and  business community.The Fed has two related jobs.The first job is to regulate banks and ensure the   health of the banking system.This task is largely the responsibility of the regional   Federal Reserve Banks.In particular, the Fed monitors each bank\u2019s financial con   dition and facilitates bank transactions by clearing checks.It also acts as a bank\u2019s   bank.That is, the Fed makes loans to banks when banks themselves want to bor   row.When financially troubled banks find themselves short of cash, the Fed acts   as a lender of last resort\u2014a lender to those who cannot borrow anywhere else\u2014in   order to maintain stability in the overall banking system.The Fed\u2019s second and more important job is to control the quantity of money   money supply that is made available in the economy, called the money supply.Decisions by   the quantity of money available policymakers concerning the money supply constitute monetary policy.At the   in the economy Federal Reserve, monetary policy is made by the Federal Open Market Committee  (FOMC).The FOMC meets about every six weeks in Washington, D.C., to discuss   monetary policy   the condition of the economy and consider changes in monetary policy.the setting of the money supply by  policymakers in the central bank   THE FEDERAL OPEN MARKET COMMITTEE   The Federal Open Market Committee is made up of the seven members of the  Board of Governors and five of the 12 regional bank presidents.All 12 regional  presidents attend each FOMC meeting, but only five get to vote.The five with voting  rights rotate among the 12 regional presidents over time.The president of the  New York Fed always gets a vote, however, because New York is the traditional   \f CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 327   financial center of the U.S. economy and because all Fed purchases and sales of  government bonds are conducted at the New York Fed\u2019s trading desk.Through the decisions of the FOMC, the Fed has the power to increase or decrease  the number of dollars in the economy.In simple metaphorical terms, you  can imagine the Fed printing up dollar bills and dropping them around the country  by helicopter.Similarly, you can imagine the Fed using a giant vacuum cleaner  to suck dollar bills out of people\u2019s wallets.Although in practice the Fed\u2019s methods  for changing the money supply are more complex and subtle than this, the  helicopter-vacuum metaphor is a good first approximation to the meaning of  monetary policy.We discuss later in this chapter how the Fed actually changes the money supply,  but it is worth noting here that the Fed\u2019s primary tool is open-market opera- tions\u2014the purchase and sale of U.S. government bonds.(Recall that a U.S.  government bond is a certificate of indebtedness of the federal government.)If the  FOMC decides to increase the money supply, the Fed creates dollars and uses  them to buy government bonds from the public in the nation\u2019s bond markets.After the purchase, these dollars are in the hands of the public.Thus, an open- market purchase of bonds by the Fed increases the money supply.Conversely, if  the FOMC decides to decrease the money supply, the Fed sells government bonds  from its portfolio to the public in the nation\u2019s bond markets.After the sale, the dollars  it receives for the bonds are out of the hands of the public.Thus, an open- market sale of bonds by the Fed decreases the money supply.The Fed is an important institution because changes in the money supply can  profoundly affect the economy.One of the Ten Principles of Economics in Chapter 1  is that prices rise when the government prints too much money.Another of the  Ten Principles of Economics is that society faces a short-run tradeoff between inflation  and unemployment.The power of the FOMC rests on these principles.For  reasons we discuss more fully in the coming chapters, the FOMC\u2019s policy decisions  have an important influence on the economy\u2019s rate of inflation in the long  run and the economy\u2019s employment and production in the short run.Indeed, the  chairman of the Federal Reserve has been called the second most powerful person  in the United States.QUICK QUIZ: What are the primary responsibilities of the Federal  Reserve?If the Fed wants to increase the supply of money, how does it  usually do it?BANKS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY  So far we have introduced the concept of \u201cmoney\u201d and discussed how the Federal  Reserve controls the supply of money by buying and selling government bonds in  open-market operations.Although this explanation of the money supply is correct,  it is not complete.In particular, it omits the central role that banks play in the monetary  system.328 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN    reserves   deposits that banks have received but  have not loaned out   \u201dI\u2019ve heard a lot about money, and now I\u2019d like to try some.\u201d   Recall that the amount of money you hold includes both currency (the bills in  your wallet and coins in your pocket) and demand deposits (the balance in your  checking account).Because demand deposits are held in banks, the behavior of  banks can influence the quantity of demand deposits in the economy and, therefore,  the money supply.This section examines how banks affect the money supply  and how they complicate the Fed\u2019s job of controlling the money supply.THE SIMPLE CASE OF 100-PERCENT-RESERVE BANKING   To see how banks influence the money supply, it is useful to imagine first a world  without any banks at all.In this simple world, currency is the only form of money.To be concrete, let\u2019s suppose that the total quantity of currency is $100.The supply  of money is, therefore, $100.Now suppose that someone opens a bank, appropriately called First National  Bank.First National Bank is only a depository institution\u2014that is, it accepts deposits  but does not make loans.The purpose of the bank is to give depositors a  safe place to keep their money.Whenever a person deposits some money, the bank  keeps the money in its vault until the depositor comes to withdraw it or writes a  check against his or her balance.Deposits that banks have received but have not  loaned out are called reserves.In this imaginary economy, all deposits are held as  reserves, so this system is called 100-percent-reserve banking.We can express the financial position of First National Bank with a T-account,  which is a simplified accounting statement that shows changes in a bank\u2019s assets  and liabilities.Here is the T-account for First National Bank if the economy\u2019s entire  $100 of money is deposited in the bank:   FIRST NATIONAL BANK   ASSETS LIABILITIES   Reserves $100.00   Deposits $100.00   \f CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 329   On the left-hand side of the T-account are the bank\u2019s assets of $100 (the reserves it  holds in its vaults).On the right-hand side of the T-account are the bank\u2019s liabilities  of $100 (the amount it owes to its depositors).Notice that the assets and liabilities  of First National Bank exactly balance.Now consider the money supply in this imaginary economy.Before First National  Bank opens, the money supply is the $100 of currency that people are holding.After the bank opens and people deposit their currency, the money supply is  the $100 of demand deposits.(There is no longer any currency outstanding, for it  is all in the bank vault.)Each deposit in the bank reduces currency and raises demand  deposits by exactly the same amount, leaving the money supply unchanged.Thus, if banks hold all deposits in reserve, banks do not influence the supply of money.MONEY CREATION WITH FRACTIONAL-RESERVE BANKING   Eventually, the bankers at First National Bank may start to reconsider their policy  of 100-percent-reserve banking.Leaving all that money sitting idle in their vaults  seems unnecessary.Why not use some of it to make loans?Families buying  houses, firms building new factories, and students paying for college would all be  happy to pay interest to borrow some of that money for a while.Of course, First  National Bank has to keep some reserves so that currency is available if depositors  want to make withdrawals.But if the flow of new deposits is roughly the same as  the flow of withdrawals, First National needs to keep only a fraction of its deposits  in reserve.Thus, First National adopts a system called fractional-reserve banking.fractional-reserve banking   The fraction of total deposits that a bank holds as reserves is called the reserve   a banking system in which banks   ratio.This ratio is determined by a combination of government regulation and   hold only a fraction of deposits   bank policy.As we discuss more fully later in the chapter, the Fed places a mini-  as reserves   mum on the amount of reserves that banks hold, called a reserve requirement.In ad-  reserve ratio   dition, banks may hold reserves above the legal minimum, called excess reserves, so   the fraction of deposits that   they can be more confident that they will not run short of cash.For our purpose   banks hold as reserves   here, we just take reserve ratio as given and examine what fractional-reserve banking  means for the money supply.Let\u2019s suppose that First National has a reserve ratio of 10 percent.This means  that it keeps 10 percent of its deposits in reserve and loans out the rest.Now let\u2019s  look again at the bank\u2019s T-account:   FIRST NATIONAL BANK   ASSETS LIABILITIES   Reserves $10.00   Deposits $100.00  Loans 90.00   First National still has $100 in liabilities because making the loans did not alter the  bank\u2019s obligation to its depositors.But now the bank has two kinds of assets: It has  $10 of reserves in its vault, and it has loans of $90.(These loans are liabilities of the  people taking out the loans but they are assets of the bank making the loans, because  the borrowers will later repay the bank.)In total, First National\u2019s assets still  equal its liabilities.Once again consider the supply of money in the economy.Before First  National makes any loans, the money supply is the $100 of deposits in the bank.330 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN   Yet when First National makes these loans, the money supply increases.The  depositors still have demand deposits totaling $100, but now the borrowers hold  $90 in currency.The money supply (which equals currency plus demand deposits)  equals $190.Thus, when banks hold only a fraction of deposits in reserve, banks create  money.At first, this creation of money by fractional-reserve banking may seem too  good to be true because it appears that the bank has created money out of thin air.To make this creation of money seem less miraculous, note that when First National  Bank loans out some of its reserves and creates money, it does not create any  wealth.Loans from First National give the borrowers some currency and thus the  ability to buy goods and services.Yet the borrowers are also taking on debts, so  the loans do not make them any richer.In other words, as a bank creates the asset  of money, it also creates a corresponding liability for its borrowers.At the end  of this process of money creation, the economy is more liquid in the sense that  there is more of the medium of exchange, but the economy is no wealthier than  before.THE MONEY MULTIPLIER   The creation of money does not stop with First National Bank.Suppose the borrower  from First National uses the $90 to buy something from someone who then  deposits the currency in Second National Bank.Here is the T-account for Second  National Bank:   SECOND NATIONAL BANK   ASSETS LIABILITIES   Reserves $ 9.00   Deposits $90.00  Loans 81.00   After the deposit, this bank has liabilities of $90.If Second National also has a reserve  ratio of 10 percent, it keeps assets of $9 in reserve and makes $81 in loans.In this way, Second National Bank creates an additional $81 of money.If this $81  is eventually deposited in Third National Bank, which also has a reserve ratio of  10 percent, this bank keeps $8.10 in reserve and makes $72.90 in loans.Here is the  T-account for Third National Bank:   THIRD NATIONAL BANK   ASSETS LIABILITIES  Reserves $ 8.10 Deposits $81.00  Loans 72.90   The process goes on and on.Each time that money is deposited and a bank loan is  made, more money is created.CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 331   How much money is eventually created in this economy?Let\u2019s add it up:   Original deposit  $ 100.00  First National lending  $ 90.00 [  .9  $100.00]  Second National lending  $ 81.00 [  .9  $90.00]  Third National lending  $ 72.90 [  .9  $81.00]   Total money supply  $1,000.00   It turns out that even though this process of money creation can continue forever,  it does not create an infinite amount of money.If you laboriously add the infinite  sequence of numbers in the foregoing example, you find the $100 of reserves generates  $1,000 of money.The amount of money the banking system generates with  each dollar of reserves is called the money multiplier.In this imaginary economy, money multiplier  where the $100 of reserves generates $1,000 of money, the money multiplier is 10. the amount of money the   What determines the size of the money multiplier?It turns out that the answer banking system generates  is simple: The money multiplier is the reciprocal of the reserve ratio.If R is the reserve with each dollar of reserves  ratio for all banks in the economy, then each dollar of reserves generates 1/R dollars  of money.In our example, R  1/10, so the money multiplier is 10.This reciprocal formula for the money multiplier makes sense.If a bank holds  $1,000 in deposits, then a reserve ratio of 1/10 (10 percent) means that the bank  must hold $100 in reserves.The money multiplier just turns this idea around: If the  banking system as a whole holds a total of $100 in reserves, it can have only $1,000  in deposits.In other words, if R is the ratio of reserves to deposits at each bank  (that is, the reserve ratio), then the ratio of deposits to reserves in the banking system  (that is, the money multiplier) must be 1/R.This formula shows how the amount of money banks create depends on the  reserve ratio.If the reserve ratio were only 1/20 (5 percent), then the banking system  would have 20 times as much in deposits as in reserves, implying a money  multiplier of 20.Each dollar of reserves would generate $20 of money.Similarly, if  the reserve ratio were 1/5 (20 percent), deposits would be 5 times reserves, the  money multiplier would be 5, and each dollar of reserves would generate $5 of  money.Thus, the higher the reserve ratio, the less of each deposit banks loan out, and the  smaller the money multiplier.In the special case of 100-percent-reserve banking, the  reserve ratio is 1, the money multiplier is 1, and banks do not make loans or create  money.THE FED\u2019S TOOLS OF MONETARY CONTROL   As we have already discussed, the Federal Reserve is responsible for controlling  the supply of money in the economy.Now that we understand how fractional- reserve banking works, we are in a better position to understand how the Fed carries  out this job.Because banks create money in a system of fractional-reserve  banking, the Fed\u2019s control of the money supply is indirect.When the Fed decides  to change the money supply, it must consider how its actions will work through  the banking system.The Fed has three tools in its monetary toolbox: open-market operations,  reserve requirements, and the discount rate.Let\u2019s discuss how the Fed uses each of  these tools.332 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN   open-market operations   the purchase and sale of U.S.  government bonds by the Fed   reserve requirements   regulations on the minimum amount  of reserves that banks must hold  against deposits   discount rate   the interest rate on the loans that the  Fed makes to banks   Open-Market Operations As we noted earlier, the Fed conducts open- market operations when it buys or sells government bonds from the public.To increase  the money supply, the Fed instructs its bond traders at the New York Fed to  buy bonds in the nation\u2019s bond markets.The dollars the Fed pays for the bonds increase  the number of dollars in circulation.Some of these new dollars are held as  currency, and some are deposited in banks.Each new dollar held as currency increases  the money supply by exactly $1.Each new dollar deposited in a bank increases  the money supply to an even greater extent because it increases reserves  and, thereby, the amount of money that the banking system can create.To reduce the money supply, the Fed does just the opposite: It sells government  bonds to the public in the nation\u2019s bond markets.The public pays for these  bonds with its holdings of currency and bank deposits, directly reducing the  amount of money in circulation.In addition, as people make withdrawals from  banks, banks find themselves with a smaller quantity of reserves.In response,  banks reduce the amount of lending, and the process of money creation reverses  itself.Open-market operations are easy to conduct.In fact, the Fed\u2019s purchases and  sales of government bonds in the nation\u2019s bond markets are similar to the transactions  that any individual might undertake for his own portfolio.(Of course, when  an individual buys or sells a bond, money changes hands, but the amount of  money in circulation remains the same.)In addition, the Fed can use open-market  operations to change the money supply by a small or large amount on any day  without major changes in laws or bank regulations.Therefore, open-market operations  are the tool of monetary policy that the Fed uses most often.Reserve Requirements The Fed also influences the money supply with  reserve requirements, which are regulations on the minimum amount of reserves  that banks must hold against deposits.Reserve requirements influence how much  money the banking system can create with each dollar of reserves.An increase in  reserve requirements means that banks must hold more reserves and, therefore,  can loan out less of each dollar that is deposited; as a result, it raises the reserve ratio,  lowers the money multiplier, and decreases the money supply.Conversely, a  decrease in reserve requirements lowers the reserve ratio, raises the money multiplier,  and increases the money supply.The Fed uses changes in reserve requirements only rarely because frequent  changes would disrupt the business of banking.When the Fed increases reserve  requirements, for instance, some banks find themselves short of reserves, even  though they have seen no change in deposits.As a result, they have to curtail lending  until they build their level of reserves to the new required level.The Discount Rate The third tool in the Fed\u2019s toolbox is the discount rate,  the interest rate on the loans that the Fed makes to banks.A bank borrows from the  Fed when it has too few reserves to meet reserve requirements.This might occur  because the bank made too many loans or because it has experienced recent withdrawals.When the Fed makes such a loan to a bank, the banking system has more  reserves than it otherwise would, and these additional reserves allow the banking  system to create more money.The Fed can alter the money supply by changing the discount rate.A higher  discount rate discourages banks from borrowing reserves from the Fed.Thus, an  increase in the discount rate reduces the quantity of reserves in the banking   \f CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 333   system, which in turn reduces the money supply.Conversely, a lower discount  rate encourages bank borrowing from the Fed, increases the quantity of reserves,  and increases the money supply.The Fed uses discount lending not only to control the money supply but also  to help financial institutions when they are in trouble.For example, in 1984, rumors  circulated that Continental Illinois National Bank had made a large number  of bad loans, and these rumors induced many depositors to withdraw their deposits.As part of an effort to save the bank, the Fed acted as a lender of last resort  and loaned Continental Illinois more than $5 billion.Similarly, when the stock  market crashed on October 19, 1987, many Wall Street brokerage firms found  themselves temporarily in need of funds to finance the high volume of stock trading.The next morning, before the stock market opened, Fed Chairman Alan  Greenspan announced the Fed\u2019s \u201creadiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support  the economic and financial system.\u201d Many economists believe that  Greenspan\u2019s reaction to the stock crash was an important reason why it had so few  repercussions.PROBLEMS IN CONTROLLING THE MONEY SUPPLY   The Fed\u2019s three tools\u2014open-market operations, reserve requirements, and the discount  rate\u2014have powerful effects on the money supply.Yet the Fed\u2019s control of  the money supply is not precise.The Fed must wrestle with two problems, each  of which arises because much of the money supply is created by our system of  fractional-reserve banking.The first problem is that the Fed does not control the amount of money that  households choose to hold as deposits in banks.The more money households deposit,  the more reserves banks have, and the more money the banking system can  create.And the less money households deposit, the less reserves banks have, and  the less money the banking system can create.To see why this is a problem, suppose  that one day people begin to lose confidence in the banking system and,  therefore, decide to withdraw deposits and hold more currency.When this happens,  the banking system loses reserves and creates less money.The money supply  falls, even without any Fed action.The second problem of monetary control is that the Fed does not control the  amount that bankers choose to lend.When money is deposited in a bank, it creates  more money only when the bank loans it out.Because banks can choose to hold  excess reserves instead, the Fed cannot be sure how much money the banking system  will create.For instance, suppose that one day bankers become more cautious  about economic conditions and decide to make fewer loans and hold greater reserves.In this case, the banking system creates less money than it otherwise  would.Because of the bankers\u2019 decision, the money supply falls.Hence, in a system of fractional-reserve banking, the amount of money in the  economy depends in part on the behavior of depositors and bankers.Because  the Fed cannot control or perfectly predict this behavior, it cannot perfectly control  the money supply.Yet, if the Fed is vigilant, these problems need not be large.The  Fed collects data on deposits and reserves from banks every week, so it is quickly  aware of any changes in depositor or banker behavior.It can, therefore, respond to  these changes and keep the money supply close to whatever level it chooses.334 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN   CASE STUDY BANK RUNS AND THE MONEY SUPPLY   Although you have probably never witnessed a bank run in real life, you may  have seen one depicted in movies such as Mary Poppins or It\u2019s a Wonderful Life.A bank run occurs when depositors suspect that a bank may go bankrupt and,  therefore, \u201crun\u201d to the bank to withdraw their deposits.Bank runs are a problem for banks under fractional-reserve banking.Because  a bank holds only a fraction of its deposits in reserve, it cannot satisfy  withdrawal requests from all depositors.Even if the bank is in fact solvent  (meaning that its assets exceed its liabilities), it will not have enough cash on  hand to allow all depositors immediate access to all of their money.When a run  occurs, the bank is forced to close its doors until some bank loans are repaid or  until some lender of last resort (such as the Fed) provides it with the currency it  needs to satisfy depositors.Bank runs complicate the control of the money supply.An important example  of this problem occurred during the Great Depression in the early 1930s.After  a wave of bank runs and bank closings, households and bankers became  more cautious.Households withdrew their deposits from banks, preferring to  hold their money in the form of currency.This decision reversed the process of  money creation, as bankers responded to falling reserves by reducing bank  loans.At the same time, bankers increased their reserve ratios so that they  would have enough cash on hand to meet their depositors\u2019 demands in any future  bank runs.The higher reserve ratio reduced the money multiplier, which  also reduced the money supply.From 1929 to 1933, the money supply fell by 28  percent, even without the Federal Reserve taking any deliberate contractionary  action.Many economists point to this massive fall in the money supply to explain  the high unemployment and falling prices that prevailed during this period.(In future chapters we examine the mechanisms by which changes in the  money supply affect unemployment and prices.)Today, bank runs are not a major problem for the banking system or the  Fed.The federal government now guarantees the safety of deposits at most  banks, primarily through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).Depositors do not run on their banks because they are confident that, even  if their bank goes bankrupt, the FDIC will make good on the deposits.The   A NOT-SO-WONDERFUL  BANK RUN  \f CHAPTER 15 THE MONETARY SYSTEM 335   policy of government deposit insurance has costs: Bankers whose deposits  are guaranteed may have too little incentive to avoid bad risks when making  loans.(This behavior is an example of a phenomenon, introduced in the preceding  chapter, called moral hazard.)But one benefit of deposit insurance is a  more stable banking system.As a result, most people see bank runs only in the  movies.QUICK QUIZ: Describe how banks create money.If the Fed wanted  to use all three of its policy tools to decrease the money supply, what  would it do?CONCLUSION  Some years ago, a book made the best-seller list with the title Secrets of the Temple:  How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country.Although no doubt an exaggeration, this  title did highlight the important role of the monetary system in our daily lives.Whenever we buy or sell anything, we are relying on the extraordinarily useful social  convention called \u201cmoney.\u201d Now that we know what money is and what determines  its supply, we can discuss how changes in the quantity of money affect  the economy.We begin to address that topic in the next chapter.Summary  The term money refers to assets that people regularly use  to buy goods and services.Money serves three functions.As a medium of  exchange, it provides the item used to make  transactions.As a unit of account, it provides the way in  which prices and other economic values are recorded.As a store of value, it provides a way of transferring  purchasing power from the present to the future.Commodity money, such as gold, is money that has  intrinsic value: It would be valued even if it were not  used as money.Fiat money, such as paper dollars, is  money without intrinsic value: It would be worthless if  it were not used as money.In the U.S. economy, money takes the form of currency  and various types of bank deposits, such as checking  accounts.The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United  States, is responsible for regulating the U.S. monetary   system.The Fed chairman is appointed by the president  and confirmed by Congress every four years.The  chairman is the lead member of the Federal Open  Market Committee, which meets about every six weeks  to consider changes in monetary policy.The Fed controls the money supply primarily through  open-market operations: The purchase of government  bonds increases the money supply, and the sale of  government bonds decreases the money supply.The  Fed can also expand the money supply by lowering  reserve requirements or decreasing the discount rate,  and it can contract the money supply by raising reserve  requirements or increasing the discount rate.When banks loan out some of their deposits, they  increase the quantity of money in the economy.Because of this role of banks in determining the  money supply, the Fed\u2019s control of the money supply  is imperfect.336 PART SIX MONEY AND PRICES IN THE LONG RUN   Key Concepts  money, p. 320 currency, p.

Massachusetts, published by a  company located in Texas, and printed on paper made from trees grown in Oregon.Every day you rely on many people from around the world, most of whom you  do not know, to provide you with the goods and services that you enjoy.Such interdependence  is possible because people trade with one another.Those people who  provide you with goods and services are not acting out of generosity or concern for  your welfare.Nor is some government agency directing them to make what you   IN THIS CHAPTER  YOU WILL .Consider how  everyone can benefit  when people trade  with one

get something in return.In subsequent chapters we will examine how our economy coordinates the ac   tivities of millions of people with varying tastes and abilities.As a starting point    for this analysis, here we consider the reasons for economic interdependence.One  of the Ten Principles of Economics highlighted in Chapter 1 is that trade can make  everyone better off.This principle explains why people trade with their neighbors  and why nations trade with other nations.In this chapter we examine this principle  more closely.What exactly do people gain when they trade with one another?Why do people choose to become interdependent?A PARABLE FOR THE MODERN ECONOMY  To understand why people choose to depend on others for goods and services and  how this choice improves their lives, let\u2019s look at a simple economy.Imagine that  there are two goods in the world\u2014meat and potatoes.And there are two people in  the world\u2014a cattle rancher and a potato farmer\u2014each of whom would like to eat  both meat and potatoes.The gains from trade are most obvious if the rancher can produce only meat  and the farmer can produce only potatoes.In one scenario, the rancher and the  farmer could choose to have nothing to do with each other.But after several  months of eating beef roasted, boiled, broiled, and grilled, the rancher might decide  that self-sufficiency is not all it\u2019s cracked up to be.The farmer, who has been  eating potatoes mashed, fried, baked, and scalloped, would likely agree.It is easy  to see that trade would allow them to enjoy greater variety: Each could then have  a hamburger with french fries.Although this scene illustrates most simply how everyone can benefit from  trade, the gains would be similar if the rancher and the farmer were each capable  of producing the other good, but only at great cost.Suppose, for example, that the  potato farmer is able to raise cattle and produce meat, but that he is not very good  at it.Similarly, suppose that the cattle rancher is able to grow potatoes, but that her  land is not very well suited for it.In this case, it is easy to see that the farmer and  the rancher can each benefit by specializing in what he or she does best and then  trading with the other.The gains from trade are less obvious, however, when one person is better at  producing every good.For example, suppose that the rancher is better at raising  cattle and better at growing potatoes than the farmer.In this case, should the  rancher or farmer choose to remain self-sufficient?Or is there still reason for them  to trade with each other?To answer this question, we need to look more closely at  the factors that affect such a decision.PRODUCTION POSSIBILITIES   Suppose that the farmer and the rancher each work 40 hours a week and can devote  this time to growing potatoes, raising cattle, or a combination of the two.Table 3-1 shows the amount of time each person requires to produce 1 pound of   \f CHAPTER 3

combinations of meat and  potatoes that the farmer can  produce.Panel (b) shows the  combinations of meat and  potatoes that the rancher can  produce.Both production  possibilities frontiers are derived  from Table 3-1 and the  assumption that the farmer and  rancher each work 40 hours per  week.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   each good.The farmer can produce a pound of potatoes in 10 hours and a pound  of meat in 20 hours.The rancher, who is more productive in both activities, can  produce a pound of potatoes in 8 hours and a pound of meat in 1 hour.Panel (a) of Figure 3-1 illustrates the amounts of meat and potatoes that the  farmer can produce.If the farmer devotes all 40 hours of his time to potatoes, he  produces 4 pounds of potatoes and no meat.If he devotes all his time to meat, he  produces 2 pounds of meat and no potatoes.If the farmer divides his time equally  between the two activities, spending 20 hours on each, he produces 2 pounds of  potatoes and 1 pound of meat.The figure shows these three possible outcomes and  all others in between.This graph is the farmer\u2019s production possibilities frontier.As we discussed in    Chapter 2, a production possibilities frontier shows the various mixes of output  that an economy can produce.It illustrates one of the Ten Principles of Economics in  Chapter 1: People face tradeoffs.Here the farmer faces a tradeoff between producing  meat and producing potatoes.You may recall that the production possibilities  frontier in Chapter 2 was drawn bowed out; in this case, the tradeoff between the   two goods depends on the amounts being produced.Here, however, the farmer\u2019s  technology for producing meat and potatoes (as summarized in Table 3-1) allows  him to switch between one good and the other at a constant rate.In this case, the  production possibilities frontier is a straight line.Panel (b) of Figure 3-1 shows the production possibilities frontier for the  rancher.If the rancher devotes all 40 hours of her time to potatoes, she produces 5  pounds of potatoes and no meat.If she devotes all her time to meat, she produces  40 pounds of meat and no potatoes.If the rancher divides her time equally, spending  20 hours on each activity, she produces 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes and 20  pounds of meat.Once again, the production possibilities frontier shows all the  possible outcomes.If the farmer and rancher choose to be self-sufficient, rather than trade with  each other, then each consumes exactly what he or she produces.In this case, the  production possibilities frontier is also the consumption possibilities frontier.That  is, without trade, Figure 3-1 shows the possible combinations of meat and potatoes  that the farmer and rancher can each consume.Although these production possibilities frontiers are useful in showing the  tradeoffs that the farmer and rancher face, they do not tell us what the farmer and  rancher will actually choose to do.To determine their choices, we need to know  the tastes of the farmer and the rancher.Let\u2019s suppose they choose the combinations  identified by points A and B in Figure 3-1: The farmer produces and consumes  2 pounds of potatoes and 1 pound of meat, while the rancher produces and  consumes 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes and 20 pounds of meat.SPECIALIZATION AND TRADE   After several years of eating combination B, the rancher gets an idea and goes to  talk to the farmer:   RANCHER: Farmer, my friend, have I got a deal for you!I know how to improve  life for both of us.I think you should stop producing meat altogether  and devote all your time to growing potatoes.According to my  calculations, if you work 40 hours a week growing potatoes, you\u2019ll   \f CHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM

you\u2019ll get to eat 3  pounds of potatoes and 3 pounds of meat every week, instead of the  2 pounds of potatoes and 1 pound of meat you now get.If you go  along with my plan, you\u2019ll have more of both foods.[To illustrate her  point, the rancher shows the farmer panel (a) of Figure 3-2.]FARMER: (sounding skeptical) That seems like a good deal for me.But I don\u2019t  understand why you are offering it.If the deal is so good for me, it  can\u2019t be good for you too.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   THE OUTCOME THE OUTCOME THE GAINS   WITHOUT TRADE: WITH TRADE: FROM TRADE:   FARMER 1 lb meat 0

potatoes.In  the end, I will also get more of both foods than I have now.[She  points out panel (b) of Figure 3-2.]FARMER: I don\u2019t know.This sounds too good to be true.RANCHER: It\u2019s really not as complicated as it seems at first.Here\u2014I have  summarized my proposal for you in a simple table.[The rancher  hands the farmer a copy of Table 3-2.]FARMER: (after pausing to study the table) These calculations seem correct, but I  am puzzled.How can this deal make us both better off?RANCHER: We can both benefit because trade allows each of us to specialize in  doing what we do best.You will spend more time growing potatoes  and less time raising cattle.I will spend more time raising cattle and  less time growing potatoes.As a result of specialization and trade,  each of us can consume both more meat and more potatoes without  working any more hours.QUICK QUIZ: Draw an example of a production possibilities frontier for  Robinson Crusoe, a shipwrecked sailor who spends his time gathering  coconuts and catching fish.Does this frontier limit Crusoe\u2019s consumption of  coconuts and fish if he lives by himself?Does he face the same limits if he can  trade with natives on the island?THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE  The rancher\u2019s explanation of the gains from trade, though correct, poses a puzzle:  If the rancher is better at both raising cattle and growing potatoes, how can the  farmer ever specialize in doing what he does best?The farmer doesn\u2019t seem to do   \f CHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE   anything best.To solve this puzzle, we need to look at the principle of comparative  advantage.As a first step in developing this principle, consider the following question: In  our example, who can produce potatoes at lower cost\u2014the farmer or the rancher?There are two possible answers, and in these two answers lie both the solution to  our puzzle and the key to understanding the gains from trade.ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE  One way to answer the question about the cost of producing potatoes is to compare  the inputs required by the two producers.The rancher needs only 8 hours to  produce a pound of potatoes, whereas the farmer needs 10 hours.Based on this information,  one might conclude that the rancher has the lower cost of producing  potatoes.Economists use the term absolute advantage when comparing the productiv-absolute advantage  ity of one person, firm, or nation to that of another.The producer that requires a the comparison among producers of a  smaller quantity of inputs to produce a good is said to have an absolute advantage good according to their productivity  in producing that good.In our example, the rancher has an absolute advantage  both in producing potatoes and in producing meat, because she requires less time  than the farmer to produce a unit of either good.OPPORTUNITY COST AND COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE  There is another way to look at the cost of producing potatoes.Rather than comparing  inputs required, we can compare the opportunity costs.Recall from Chapter  1 that the opportunity cost of some item is what we give up to get that item.In opportunity cost  our example, we assumed that the farmer and the rancher each spend 40 hours a whatever must be given up to obtain  week working.Time spent producing potatoes, therefore, takes away from time some item  available for producing meat.As the rancher and farmer change their allocations  of time between producing the two goods, they move along their production possibility  frontiers; in a sense, they are using one good to produce the other.The opportunity  cost measures the tradeoff that each of them faces.Let\u2019s first consider the rancher\u2019s opportunity cost.Producing 1 pound of potatoes  takes her 8 hours of work.When the rancher spends that 8 hours producing  potatoes, she spends 8 hours less producing meat.Because the rancher needs only  1 hour to produce 1 pound of meat, 8 hours of work would yield 8 pounds of meat.Hence, the rancher\u2019s opportunity cost of 1 pound of potatoes is 8 pounds of meat.Now consider the farmer\u2019s opportunity cost.Producing 1 pound of potatoes  takes him 10 hours.Because he needs 20 hours to produce 1 pound of meat, 10  hours would yield 1/2 pound of meat.Hence, the farmer\u2019s opportunity cost of 1  pound of potatoes is 1/2 pound of meat.Table 3-3 shows the opportunity cost of meat and potatoes for the two producers.Notice that the opportunity cost of meat is the inverse of the opportunity  cost of potatoes.Because 1 pound of potatoes costs the rancher 8 pounds of meat,  1 pound of meat costs the rancher 1/8 pound of potatoes.Similarly, because 1  pound of potatoes costs the farmer 1/2 pound of meat, 1 pound of meat costs the comparative advantage  farmer 2 pounds of potatoes.the comparison among producers  Economists use the term comparative advantage when describing the oppor-of a good according to their  tunity cost of two producers.The producer who has the smaller opportunity cost opportunity cost   \f PART ONE INTRODUCTION   Table 3-3  OPPORTUNITY COST OF:   THE OPPORTUNITY COST OF  MEAT AND POTATOES 1 POUND OF MEAT 1 POUND OF POTATOES   FARMER 2 lbs potatoes 1/2 lb meat  RANCHER 1/8 lb potatoes 8 lbs meat   of producing a good\u2014that is, who has to give up less of other goods to produce  it\u2014is said to have a comparative advantage in producing that good.In our example,  the farmer has a lower opportunity cost of producing potatoes than the  rancher (1/2 pound versus 8 pounds of meat).The rancher has a lower opportunity  cost of producing meat than the farmer (1/8 pound versus 2 pounds of potatoes).Thus, the farmer has a comparative advantage in growing potatoes, and the  rancher has a comparative advantage in producing meat.Notice that it would be impossible for the same person to have a comparative  advantage in both goods.Because the opportunity cost of one good is the inverse  of the opportunity cost of the other, if a person\u2019s opportunity cost of one good is  relatively high, his opportunity cost of the other good must be relatively low.Comparative  advantage reflects the relative opportunity cost.Unless two people have  exactly the same opportunity cost, one person will have a comparative advantage  in one good, and the other person will have a comparative advantage in the other  good.COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND TRADE   Differences in opportunity cost and comparative advantage create the gains from  trade.When each person specializes in producing the good for which he or she has  a comparative advantage, total production in the economy rises, and this increase  in the size of the economic pie can be used to make everyone better off.In other  words, as long as two people have different opportunity costs, each can benefit  from trade by obtaining a good at a price lower than his or her opportunity cost of  that good.Consider the proposed deal from the viewpoint of the farmer.The farmer gets  3 pounds of meat in exchange for 1 pound of potatoes.In other words, the farmer  buys each pound of meat for a price of 1/3 pound of potatoes.This price of meat  is lower than his opportunity cost for 1 pound of meat, which is 2 pounds of potatoes.Thus, the farmer benefits from the deal because he gets to buy meat at a good  price.Now consider the deal from the rancher\u2019s viewpoint.The rancher buys 1  pound of potatoes for a price of 3 pounds of meat.This price of potatoes is lower  than her opportunity cost of 1 pound of potatoes, which is 8 pounds of meat.Thus,  the rancher benefits because she gets to buy potatoes at a good price.These benefits arise because each person concentrates on the activity for which  he or she has the lower opportunity cost: The farmer spends more time growing  potatoes, and the rancher spends more time producing meat.As a result, the total  production of potatoes and the total production of meat both rise, and the farmer   \f CHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE   Economists have long under- stood the principle of compara- tive advantage.Here is how the  great economist Adam Smith  put the argument:  It is a maxim of every  prudent master of a family,  never to attempt to make  at home what it will cost  him more to make than to  buy.The tailor does not  attempt to make his own  shoes, but buys them of the shoemaker.The shoemaker  does not attempt to make his own clothes but employs a  tailor.The farmer attempts to make neither the one nor  the other, but employs those different artificers.All of  them find it for their interest to employ their whole  industry in a way in which they have some advantage over  their neighbors, and to purchase with a part of its  produce, or what is the same thing, with the price of part  of it, whatever else they have occasion for.This quotation is from Smith\u2019s 1776 book, An Inquiry into  the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, which was  a landmark in the analysis of trade  and economic interdependence.Smith\u2019s book inspired David  Ricardo, a millionaire stockbroker,  to become an economist.In his  1817 book, Principles of Political  Economy and Taxation, Ricardo de- veloped the principle of compara- tive advantage as we know it today.His defense of free trade was not a  mere academic exercise.Ricardo  put his economic beliefs to work as  a member of the British Parliament,  where he opposed the Corn Laws,  which restricted the import of grain.The conclusions of Adam Smith and David Ricardo on  the gains from trade have held up well over time.Although  economists often disagree on questions of policy, they are  united in their support of free trade.Moreover, the central  argument for free trade has not changed much in the past  two centuries.Even though the field of economics has  broadened its scope and refined its theories since the time  of Smith and Ricardo, economists\u2019 opposition to trade re- strictions is still based largely on the principle of compara- tive advantage.DAVID RICARDO  FYI  The Legacy of  Adam Smith  and David  Ricardo  and rancher share the benefits of this increased production.The moral of the story  of the farmer and the rancher should now be clear: Trade can benefit everyone in society  because it allows people to specialize in activities in which they have a comparative  advantage.QUICK QUIZ: Robinson Crusoe can gather 10 coconuts or catch 1 fish per  hour.His friend Friday can gather 30 coconuts or catch 2 fish per hour.What is  Crusoe\u2019s opportunity cost of catching one fish?What is Friday\u2019s?Who has an  absolute advantage in catching fish?Who has a comparative advantage in  catching fish?APPLICATIONS OF COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE  The principle of comparative advantage explains interdependence and the gains  from trade.Because interdependence is so prevalent in the modern world, the  principle of comparative advantage has many applications.Here are two examples,  one fanciful and one of great practical importance.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   SHOULD TIGER WOODS MOW HIS OWN LAWN?Tiger Woods spends a lot of time walking around on grass.One of the most talented  golfers of all time, he can hit a drive and sink a putt in a way that most casual  golfers only dream of doing.Most likely, he is talented at other activities too.For example, let\u2019s imagine that Woods can mow his lawn faster than anyone else.But just because he can mow his lawn fast, does this mean he should?To answer this question, we can use the concepts of opportunity cost and comparative  advantage.Let\u2019s say that Woods can mow his lawn in 2 hours.In that same  2 hours, he could film a television commercial for Nike and earn $10,000.By contrast,  Forrest Gump, the boy next door, can mow Woods\u2019s lawn in 4 hours.In that  same 4 hours, he could work at McDonald\u2019s and earn $20.In this example, Woods\u2019s opportunity cost of mowing the lawn is $10,000 and  Forrest\u2019s opportunity cost is $20.Woods has an absolute advantage in mowing  lawns because he can do the work in less time.Yet Forrest has a comparative advantage  in mowing lawns because he has the lower opportunity cost.IN THE NEWS  Who has a Comparative  Advantage in  Producing Lamb?A COMMON BARRIER TO FREE TRADE  among countries is tariffs, which are  taxes on the import of goods from  abroad.In the following opinion column,  economist Douglas Irwin discusses  a recent example of their use.Lamb Tariffs Fleece   U.S. Consumers  BY DOUGLAS A. IRWIN  President Clinton dealt a serious blow to  free trade last Wednesday, when he announced  that the U.S. would impose stiff  import tariffs on lamb from Australia and  New Zealand.His decision undercuts   American leadership and makes a mockery  of the administration\u2019s claims that it  favors free and fair trade.U.S. sheep producers have long  been dependent on government.For  more than half a century, until Congress  enacted farm-policy reforms in 1995,  they received subsidies for wool.Having  lost that handout, saddled with high  costs and inefficiencies, and facing domestic  competition from chicken, beef,  and pork, sheep producers sought to  stop foreign competition by filing for import  relief.Almost all U.S. lamb imports come  from Australia and New Zealand, major  agricultural producers with a crushing  comparative advantage.New Zealand  has fewer than four million people but as  many as 60 million sheep (compared  with about seven million sheep in the  U.S.).New Zealand\u2019s farmers have invested  substantial resources in new  technology and effective marketing,  making them among the most efficient  producers in the world.New Zealand  also eliminated domestic agricultural   subsidies in the free-market reforms of  the 1950s, and is a free-trading country,  on track to eliminate all import tariffs by  2006.Rather than emulate this example,  the American Sheep Industry Association,  among others, filed an \u201cescape  clause\u201d petition under the Trade Act  of 1974, which allows temporary  \u201cbreathing space\u201d protection to import- competing industries.Under the escape- clause provision, a petitioning industry is  required to present an adjustment plan  to ensure that it undertakes steps to become  competitive in the future.The tariff  protection is usually limited and scheduled  to be phased out.The U.S. International Trade Commission  determines whether imports are  a cause of \u201cserious injury\u201d to the domestic  industry and, if so, proposes a  remedy, which the president has full discretion  to adopt, change or reject.In  February, the ITC did not find that the domestic  industry had suffered \u201cserious injury,\u201d  but rather adopted the weaker  ruling that imports were \u201ca substantial   \f CHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE   The gains from trade in this example are tremendous.Rather than mowing his  own lawn, Woods should make the commercial and hire Forrest to mow the lawn.As long as Woods pays Forrest more than $20 and less than $10,000, both of them  are better off.SHOULD THE UNITED STATES TRADE  WITH OTHER COUNTRIES?imports   Just as individuals can benefit from specialization and trade with one another, as   goods produced abroad and sold   the farmer and rancher did, so can populations of people in different countries.domestically   Many of the goods that Americans enjoy are produced abroad, and many of the  goods produced in the United States are sold abroad.Goods produced abroad and exports  sold domestically are called imports.Goods produced domestically and sold goods produced domestically and  abroad are called exports.sold abroad   cause of threat of serious injury.\u201d The  ITC did not propose to roll back imports,  only to impose a 20% tariff (declining  over four years) on imports above last  year\u2019s levels.The administration at first appeared  to be considering less restrictive measures.Australia and New Zealand even  offered financial assistance to the U.S.  producers, and the administration delayed  any announcement and appeared  to be working toward a compromise.But  these hopes were completely dashed  with the shocking final decision, in which  the administration capitulated to the demands  of the sheep industry and its advocates  in Congress.The congressional charge was led  by Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), a  member of the Agriculture Committee  whose sister, a sheep producer, had appeared  before the ITC to press for higher  tariffs.The administration opted for .[the following:] On top of existing tariffs,  the president imposed a 9% tariff on all  imports in the first year (declining to 6%  and then 3% in years two and three), and   a whopping 40% tariff on imports above  last year\u2019s levels (dropping to 32% and  24%).The American Sheep Industry Association\u2019s  president happily announced  that the move will \u201cbring some stability  to the market.\u201d Whenever producers  speak of bringing stability to the market,  you know that consumers are getting  fleeced.The lamb decision, while little noticed  at home, has been closely followed  abroad.The decision undercuts the administration\u2019s  free-trade rhetoric and  harms its efforts to get other countries  to open up their markets.Some import  relief had been expected, but not so  clearly protectionist as what finally materialized.The extreme decision has outraged  farmers in Australia and New  Zealand, and officials there have vowed  to take the U.S. to a WTO dispute settlement  panel.The administration\u2019s timing could  not have been worse.The decision came  right after an Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation  summit reaffirmed its commit   ment to reduce trade barriers, and a few  months before the World Trade Organization\u2019s  November meeting in Seattle,  where the WTO is to launch a new round  of multilateral trade negotiations.A principal  U.S. objective at the summit is the  reduction of agricultural protection in Europe  and elsewhere.In 1947, facing an election the next  year, President Truman courageously resisted  special interest pressure and vetoed  a bill to impose import quotas on  wool, which would have jeopardized the  first postwar multilateral trade negotiations  due to start later that year.In contrast,  Mr. Clinton, though a lame duck,  caved in to political pressure.If the U.S.,  whose booming economy is the envy of  the world, cannot resist protectionism,  how can it expect other countries to  do so?SOURCE: The Wall Street Journal, July 12, 1999,  p. A28.PART ONE INTRODUCTION   To see how countries can benefit from trade, suppose there are two countries,  the United States and Japan, and two goods, food and cars.Imagine that the two  countries produce cars equally well: An American worker and a Japanese worker  can each produce 1 car per month.By contrast, because the United States has more  and better land, it is better at producing food: A U.S. worker can produce 2 tons of  food per month, whereas a Japanese worker can produce only 1 ton of food per  month.The principle of comparative advantage states that each good should be produced  by the country that has the smaller opportunity cost of producing that  good.Because the opportunity cost of a car is 2 tons of food in the United States  but only 1 ton of food in Japan, Japan has a comparative advantage in producing  cars.Japan should produce more cars than it wants for its own use and export  some of them to the United States.Similarly, because the opportunity cost of a ton  of food is 1 car in Japan but only 1/2 car in the United States, the United States has  a comparative advantage in producing food.The United States should produce  more food than it wants to consume and export some of it to Japan.Through specialization  and trade, both countries can have more food and more cars.In reality, of course, the issues involved in trade among nations are more complex  than this example suggests, as we will see in Chapter 9.Most important  among these issues is that each country has many citizens with different interests.International trade can make some individuals worse off, even as it makes  the country as a whole better off.When the United States exports food and imports  cars, the impact on an American farmer is not the same as the impact on an  American autoworker.Yet, contrary to the opinions sometimes voiced by politicians  and political commentators, international trade is not like war, in which  some countries win and others lose.Trade allows all countries to achieve greater  prosperity.QUICK QUIZ: Suppose that the world\u2019s fastest typist happens to be  trained in brain surgery.Should he do his own typing or hire a secretary?CONCLUSION  The principle of comparative advantage shows that trade can make everyone better  off.You should now understand more fully the benefits of living in an interdependent  economy.But having seen why interdependence is desirable, you might  naturally ask how it is possible.How do free societies coordinate the diverse activities  of all the people involved in their economies?What ensures that goods and  services will get from those who should be producing them to those who should  be consuming them?In a world with only two people, such as the rancher and the farmer, the answer  is simple: These two people can directly bargain and allocate resources between  themselves.In the real world with billions of people, the answer is less  obvious.We take up this issue in the next chapter, where we see that free societies  allocate resources through the market forces of supply and demand.CHAPTER 3 INTERDEPENDENCE AND THE GAINS FROM TRADE   Summary  Each person consumes goods and services produced by  many other people both in our country and around the  world.Interdependence and trade are desirable because  they allow everyone to enjoy a greater quantity and  variety of goods and services.There are two ways to compare the ability of two people  in producing a good.The person who can produce the  good with the smaller quantity of inputs is said to have  an absolute advantage in producing the good.The person  who has the smaller opportunity cost of producing the  good is said to have a comparative advantage.The gains   from trade are based on comparative advantage, not  absolute advantage.Trade makes everyone better off because it allows  people to specialize in those activities in which they  have a comparative advantage.The principle of comparative advantage applies to  countries as well as to people.Economists use the  principle of comparative advantage to advocate free  trade among countries.Key Concepts  absolute advantage, p. 53 comparative advantage,
